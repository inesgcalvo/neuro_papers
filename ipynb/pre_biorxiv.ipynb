       " 'abstract': 'There are no known drugs or drug combinations that promote substantial central nervous system axonal regeneration after injury. We used systems pharmacology approaches to model pathways underlying axonal growth and identify a four-drug combination that regulates multiple subcellular processes in the cell body and axon using the optic nerve crush model in rats. We intravitreally injected agonists HU-210 (cannabinoid receptor-1) and IL-6 (interleukin 6 receptor) to stimulate retinal ganglion cells for axonal growth. We applied, in gel foam at the site of nerve injury, Taxol to stabilize growing microtubules, and activated protein C to clear the debris field since computational models predicted that this drug combination regulating two subcellular processes at the growth cone produces synergistic growth. Morphology experiments show that the four-drug combination promotes axonal regrowth to the optic chiasm and beyond. Physiologically, drug treatment restored pattern electroretinograms and some of the animals had detectable visual evoked potentials in the brain and behavioral optokinetic responses. We conclude that spatially targeted drug treatment can promote robust axonal regeneration and can restore limited functional recovery.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The timescales of the dynamics of a system depend on the combination of the timescales of its components and of its transmission delays. Parkinsons disease is characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons and the emergence of strong {beta}-band (15-35Hz) oscillations throughout the basal ganglia nuclei. Here we combine experimental stimulation data from ten studies, that reveal the timing of excitatory and inhibitory events in the basal ganglia circuit, to estimate its set of transmission delays. In doing so, we reveal possible inconsistencies in the existing data, calling for replications, and we propose two possible sets of transmission delays.\\n\\nWe then integrate these delays in a model of the primate basal ganglia, that does not rely on direct and indirect pathways segregation, and show that, while much attention has been given to the role of the striatal dopaminergic receptors in Parkinsons disease symptoms, extrastriatal dopaminergic depletion in the external part of the globus pallidus and in the subthalamic nucleus is sufficient to generate {beta}-band oscillations in the high part of the band. More specifically, we show that that D2 and D5 dopamine receptors in these nuclei play opposing roles in the emergence of {beta}-band oscillations, thereby explaining how completely deactivating D5 receptors in the subthalamic nucleus can, paradoxically, cancel oscillations.',\n",

Participants performed a cue-guided perceptual decision task with independently-varying memory and sensory evidence. Cues established expectations by reminding participants of past stimulus-stimulus pairings, which predicted the likely target in a subsequent noisy image stream. Participants responses used both memory and sensory information, in accordance to their relative reliability. Formal model comparison showed that the sensory inference was best explained when its parameters were set dynamically at each trial by evidence sampled from memory. Supporting this model, neural pattern analysis revealed that responses to the probe were modulated by the specific content and fidelity of memory reinstatement that occurred before the probe appeared. Together, these results suggest that perceptual decisions arise from the continuous sampling of memory and sensory evidence.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The protease caspase-3 is a key mediator of apoptotic programmed cell death. But weak or transient caspase activity can contribute to neuronal differentiation, axonal pathfinding, and synaptic long-term depression. Despite the importance of sublethal, or nonapoptotic, caspase activity in neurodevelopment and neural plasticity, there has been no simple method for mapping and quantifying nonapoptotic caspase activity in rodent brains. We therefore generated a transgenic mouse expressing a highly sensitive and specific fluorescent reporter of caspase activity, with peak signal localized to the nucleus. As a proof of concept, we first obtained evidence that nonapoptotic caspase activity influences neurophysiology in an amygdalar circuit. Then focusing on the amygdala, we were able to quantify a sex-specific persistent elevation in caspase activity in females after restraint stress. This simple in vivo caspase activity reporter will facilitate systems-level studies of apoptotic and nonapoptotic phenomena in behavioral and pathological models.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCaspase-3 is an enzyme that can cause cell death when highly active but can also perform important cellular functions, such as maturation and structural changes, when only weakly or transiently active. Despite the importance of this nonlethal type of caspase activity, there is no straightforward method to measure it in live rodents. We therefore developed mice that have a fluorescent reporter that is sensitive enough to detect nonlethal caspase activity. Surprisingly, we found that weak caspase activity influences the synchrony of neuronal firing across different brain regions. We also observed increased caspase activity in female mice after severe stress. This simple caspase activity reporter can subserve multiple applications in behavior and pathology research.',\n",

This perceptual variability is presumably caused by neural variability in our brains. How much of the neural variability that correlates with the perceptual variability is present in the primary visual cortex (V1), the first cortical processing stage of visual information? To address this question, we recorded neural population responses from V1 using voltage-sensitive dye imaging while monkeys performed a challenging reaction-time visual detection task. We found that V1 population responses in the period leading to the decision correspond more closely to the monkeys report than to the visual stimulus. These results, together with a simple computational model that allows one to quantify the captured choice-related variability, suggest that most of this variability is present in V1 as additive noise, and that areas downstream to V1 contain relatively little independent choice-related variability.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Recent proposals in quantum gravity have suggested that unknown systems can mediate entanglement between two known quantum systems, if and only if the mediator itself is non-classical. This approach may be applicable to the brain, where speculations about quantum operations in consciousness and cognition have a long history.\\n\\nProton spins of bulk water, which most likely interfere with any brain function, can act as the known quantum systems. If an unknown mediator exists, then NMR methods based on multiple quantum coherence (MQC) can act as entanglement witness. However, there are doubts that todays NMR signals can contain quantum correlations in general, and specifically in the brain environment. Here, we used a witness protocol based on zero quantum coherence (ZQC) whereby we minimised the classical signals to circumvent the NMR detection limits for quantum correlation. For short repetitive periods, we found evoked signals in most parts of the brain, whereby the temporal appearance resembled heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs). We found that those signals had no correlates with any classical NMR contrast. Similar to HEPs, the evoked signal depended on conscious awareness. Consciousness-related or electrophysiological signals are unknown in NMR. Remarkably, these signals only appeared if the local properties of the magnetisation were reduced. Our findings suggest that we may have witnessed entanglement mediated by consciousness-related brain functions. Those brain functions must then operate non-classically, which would mean that consciousness is non-classical.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Humans and animals make predictions about the rewards they expect to receive in different situations. In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as value representations, and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive choice: the expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best option is selected. Secondly, they support learning: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. Whether these different functions are mediated by different neural representations remains an open question. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that computationally separates learning from choosing. We investigate the role of value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based cognition. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbations indicate that these representations do not directly drive choice. Instead, they signal expected reward information to a learning process elsewhere in the brain that updates choice mechanisms.',\n",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease.

Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors.

The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Monosynaptic tracing using rabies virus is an important technique in neuroscience, allowing brain- wide labeling of neurons directly presynaptic to a targeted neuronal population. A 2017 article reported development of a noncytotoxic version - a major advance - based on attenuating the rabies virus by addition of a destabilization domain to the C-terminus of a viral protein. However, this modification did not appear to hinder the ability of the virus to spread between neurons. We analyzed two viruses provided by the authors and show here that both were mutants that had lost the intended modification, explaining the papers paradoxical results. We then made a virus that actually did have the intended modification in at least the majority of virions and found that it did not spread efficiently under the conditions described in the original paper, namely, without an exogenous protease being expressed in order to remove the destabilization domain. We found that it did spread when the protease was supplied, although this also appeared to result in the deaths of most source cells by three weeks postinjection. We conclude that the new approach is not robust but that it could become a viable technique given further optimization and validation.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTRabies virus, which spreads between synaptically-connected neurons, has been one of the primary tools used by neuroscientists to reveal the organization of the brain. A new modification to rabies virus was recently reported to allow the mapping of connected neurons without adverse effects on the cells health, unlike earlier versions. Here we show that the conclusions of that study were probably incorrect and based on having used viruses that had lost the intended modification because of mutations. We also show that a rabies virus that does retain the intended modification does not spread efficiently between neurons under the conditions reported previously; however, it does spread between neurons under different conditions, suggesting that the approach may be successful if refined further.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Monosynaptic tracing using rabies virus is an important technique in neuroscience, allowing brain- wide labeling of neurons directly presynaptic to a targeted neuronal population. A 2017 article reported development of a noncytotoxic version - a major advance - based on attenuating the rabies virus by addition of a destabilization domain to the C-terminus of a viral protein. However, this modification did not appear to hinder the ability of the virus to spread between neurons. We analyzed two viruses provided by the authors and show here that both were mutants that had lost the intended modification, explaining the papers paradoxical results. We then made a virus that actually did have the intended modification in at least the majority of virions and found that it did not spread efficiently under the conditions described in the original paper, namely, without an exogenous protease being expressed in order to remove the destabilization domain. We found that it did spread when the protease was supplied, although this also appeared to result in the deaths of most source cells by three weeks postinjection. We conclude that the new approach is not robust but that it could become a viable technique given further optimization and validation.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTRabies virus, which spreads between synaptically-connected neurons, has been one of the primary tools used by neuroscientists to reveal the organization of the brain. A new modification to rabies virus was recently reported to allow the mapping of connected neurons without adverse effects on the cells health, unlike earlier versions. Here we show that the conclusions of that study were probably incorrect and based on having used viruses that had lost the intended modification because of mutations. We also show that a rabies virus that does retain the intended modification does not spread efficiently between neurons under the conditions reported previously; however, it does spread between neurons under different conditions, suggesting that the approach may be successful if refined further.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Sensory and motor processes undergo massive developmental changes over at least a decade in human development. Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges. Here, we assessed coordinative abilities of 120 children aged 4-12 for the two hands or a hand with another sensory signal in multiple, highly comparable sensorimotor tasks. This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains. Here, we charted the performance of 4-12- year-olds in six coordinative tasks that are all based on a common experimental paradigm but address three different sensorimotor-cognitive domains. This approach characterizes dependencies between multiple aspects of cognitive modulation in the interplay of sensory integration and motor control.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'In developing brains, activity-dependent remodeling facilitates the formation of precise neuronal connectivity. Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'There are no known drugs or drug combinations that promote substantial central nervous system axonal regeneration after injury. We used systems pharmacology approaches to model pathways underlying axonal growth and identify a four-drug combination that regulates multiple subcellular processes in the cell body and axon using the optic nerve crush model in rats. We intravitreally injected agonists HU-210 (cannabinoid receptor-1) and IL-6 (interleukin 6 receptor) to stimulate retinal ganglion cells for axonal growth. We applied, in gel foam at the site of nerve injury, Taxol to stabilize growing microtubules, and activated protein C to clear the debris field since computational models predicted that this drug combination regulating two subcellular processes at the growth cone produces synergistic growth. Morphology experiments show that the four-drug combination promotes axonal regrowth to the optic chiasm and beyond. Physiologically, drug treatment restored pattern electroretinograms and some of the animals had detectable visual evoked potentials in the brain and behavioral optokinetic responses. We conclude that spatially targeted drug treatment can promote robust axonal regeneration and can restore limited functional recovery.',\n",

Parkinsons disease is characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons and the emergence of strong {beta}-band (15-35Hz) oscillations throughout the basal ganglia nuclei. Here we combine experimental stimulation data from ten studies, that reveal the timing of excitatory and inhibitory events in the basal ganglia circuit, to estimate its set of transmission delays. In doing so, we reveal possible inconsistencies in the existing data, calling for replications, and we propose two possible sets of transmission delays.\\n\\nWe then integrate these delays in a model of the primate basal ganglia, that does not rely on direct and indirect pathways segregation, and show that, while much attention has been given to the role of the striatal dopaminergic receptors in Parkinsons disease symptoms, extrastriatal dopaminergic depletion in the external part of the globus pallidus and in the subthalamic nucleus is sufficient to generate {beta}-band oscillations in the high part of the band. More specifically, we show that that D2 and D5 dopamine receptors in these nuclei play opposing roles in the emergence of {beta}-band oscillations, thereby explaining how completely deactivating D5 receptors in the subthalamic nucleus can, paradoxically, cancel oscillations.',\n",

Participants performed a cue-guided perceptual decision task with independently-varying memory and sensory evidence. Cues established expectations by reminding participants of past stimulus-stimulus pairings, which predicted the likely target in a subsequent noisy image stream. Participants responses used both memory and sensory information, in accordance to their relative reliability. Formal model comparison showed that the sensory inference was best explained when its parameters were set dynamically at each trial by evidence sampled from memory. Supporting this model, neural pattern analysis revealed that responses to the probe were modulated by the specific content and fidelity of memory reinstatement that occurred before the probe appeared.

       " 'abstract': 'The protease caspase-3 is a key mediator of apoptotic programmed cell death. But weak or transient caspase activity can contribute to neuronal differentiation, axonal pathfinding, and synaptic long-term depression. Despite the importance of sublethal, or nonapoptotic, caspase activity in neurodevelopment and neural plasticity, there has been no simple method for mapping and quantifying nonapoptotic caspase activity in rodent brains. We therefore generated a transgenic mouse expressing a highly sensitive and specific fluorescent reporter of caspase activity, with peak signal localized to the nucleus. As a proof of concept, we first obtained evidence that nonapoptotic caspase activity influences neurophysiology in an amygdalar circuit. Then focusing on the amygdala, we were able to quantify a sex-specific persistent elevation in caspase activity in females after restraint stress. This simple in vivo caspase activity reporter will facilitate systems-level studies of apoptotic and nonapoptotic phenomena in behavioral and pathological models.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCaspase-3 is an enzyme that can cause cell death when highly active but can also perform important cellular functions, such as maturation and structural changes, when only weakly or transiently active. Despite the importance of this nonlethal type of caspase activity, there is no straightforward method to measure it in live rodents. We therefore developed mice that have a fluorescent reporter that is sensitive enough to detect nonlethal caspase activity. Surprisingly, we found that weak caspase activity influences the synchrony of neuronal firing across different brain regions. We also observed increased caspase activity in female mice after severe stress. This simple caspase activity reporter can subserve multiple applications in behavior and pathology research.',\n",

To address this question, we recorded neural population responses from V1 using voltage-sensitive dye imaging while monkeys performed a challenging reaction-time visual detection task. We found that V1 population responses in the period leading to the decision correspond more closely to the monkeys report than to the visual stimulus.

This approach may be applicable to the brain, where speculations about quantum operations in consciousness and cognition have a long history.\\n\\nProton spins of bulk water, which most likely interfere with any brain function, can act as the known quantum systems. If an unknown mediator exists, then NMR methods based on multiple quantum coherence (MQC) can act as entanglement witness. However, there are doubts that todays NMR signals can contain quantum correlations in general, and specifically in the brain environment. Here, we used a witness protocol based on zero quantum coherence (ZQC) whereby we minimised the classical signals to circumvent the NMR detection limits for quantum correlation. For short repetitive periods, we found evoked signals in most parts of the brain, whereby the temporal appearance resembled heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs). We found that those signals had no correlates with any classical NMR contrast. Similar to HEPs, the evoked signal depended on conscious awareness. Consciousness-related or electrophysiological signals are unknown in NMR. Remarkably, these signals only appeared if the local properties of the magnetisation were reduced. Our findings suggest that we may have witnessed entanglement mediated by consciousness-related brain functions. Those brain functions must then operate non-classically, which would mean that consciousness is non-classical.',\n",

In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as value representations, and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive choice: the expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best option is selected. Secondly, they support learning: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. Whether these different functions are mediated by different neural representations remains an open question. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that computationally separates learning from choosing. We investigate the role of value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based cognition. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbations indicate that these representations do not directly drive choice.

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'What is the relationship between language and complex thought? In the context of deductive reasoning there are two main views. Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Midbrain dopamine neurons are essential for flexible control of adaptive behaviors. DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The organizational principles of glia remain largely unknown despite their vital role in nervous system function. Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task.

       " 'abstract': 'Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety/stressor disorders frequently co-occur and this dual diagnosis represents a major health and economic problem worldwide. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Sensory and motor processes undergo massive developmental changes over at least a decade in human development. Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges. Here, we assessed coordinative abilities of 120 children aged 4-12 for the two hands or a hand with another sensory signal in multiple, highly comparable sensorimotor tasks. This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains. Here, we charted the performance of 4-12- year-olds in six coordinative tasks that are all based on a common experimental paradigm but address three different sensorimotor-cognitive domains. This approach characterizes dependencies between multiple aspects of cognitive modulation in the interplay of sensory integration and motor control.',\n",

Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

We used systems pharmacology approaches to model pathways underlying axonal growth and identify a four-drug combination that regulates multiple subcellular processes in the cell body and axon using the optic nerve crush model in rats. We intravitreally injected agonists HU-210 (cannabinoid receptor-1) and IL-6 (interleukin 6 receptor) to stimulate retinal ganglion cells for axonal growth. We applied, in gel foam at the site of nerve injury, Taxol to stabilize growing microtubules, and activated protein C to clear the debris field since computational models predicted that this drug combination regulating two subcellular processes at the growth cone produces synergistic growth. Morphology experiments show that the four-drug combination promotes axonal regrowth to the optic chiasm and beyond. Physiologically, drug treatment restored pattern electroretinograms and some of the animals had detectable visual evoked potentials in the brain and behavioral optokinetic responses. We conclude that spatially targeted drug treatment can promote robust axonal regeneration and can restore limited functional recovery.',\n",

Parkinsons disease is characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons and the emergence of strong {beta}-band (15-35Hz) oscillations throughout the basal ganglia nuclei. Here we combine experimental stimulation data from ten studies, that reveal the timing of excitatory and inhibitory events in the basal ganglia circuit, to estimate its set of transmission delays. In doing so, we reveal possible inconsistencies in the existing data, calling for replications, and we propose two possible sets of transmission delays.\\n\\nWe then integrate these delays in a model of the primate basal ganglia, that does not rely on direct and indirect pathways segregation, and show that, while much attention has been given to the role of the striatal dopaminergic receptors in Parkinsons disease symptoms, extrastriatal dopaminergic depletion in the external part of the globus pallidus and in the subthalamic nucleus is sufficient to generate {beta}-band oscillations in the high part of the band.

Participants responses used both memory and sensory information, in accordance to their relative reliability. Formal model comparison showed that the sensory inference was best explained when its parameters were set dynamically at each trial by evidence sampled from memory. Supporting this model, neural pattern analysis revealed that responses to the probe were modulated by the specific content and fidelity of memory reinstatement that occurred before the probe appeared.

       " 'abstract': 'The protease caspase-3 is a key mediator of apoptotic programmed cell death. But weak or transient caspase activity can contribute to neuronal differentiation, axonal pathfinding, and synaptic long-term depression. Despite the importance of sublethal, or nonapoptotic, caspase activity in neurodevelopment and neural plasticity, there has been no simple method for mapping and quantifying nonapoptotic caspase activity in rodent brains. We therefore generated a transgenic mouse expressing a highly sensitive and specific fluorescent reporter of caspase activity, with peak signal localized to the nucleus. As a proof of concept, we first obtained evidence that nonapoptotic caspase activity influences neurophysiology in an amygdalar circuit. Then focusing on the amygdala, we were able to quantify a sex-specific persistent elevation in caspase activity in females after restraint stress. This simple in vivo caspase activity reporter will facilitate systems-level studies of apoptotic and nonapoptotic phenomena in behavioral and pathological models.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCaspase-3 is an enzyme that can cause cell death when highly active but can also perform important cellular functions, such as maturation and structural changes, when only weakly or transiently active. Despite the importance of this nonlethal type of caspase activity, there is no straightforward method to measure it in live rodents. We therefore developed mice that have a fluorescent reporter that is sensitive enough to detect nonlethal caspase activity. Surprisingly, we found that weak caspase activity influences the synchrony of neuronal firing across different brain regions. We also observed increased caspase activity in female mice after severe stress. This simple caspase activity reporter can subserve multiple applications in behavior and pathology research.',\n",

This perceptual variability is presumably caused by neural variability in our brains. How much of the neural variability that correlates with the perceptual variability is present in the primary visual cortex (V1), the first cortical processing stage of visual information? To address this question, we recorded neural population responses from V1 using voltage-sensitive dye imaging while monkeys performed a challenging reaction-time visual detection task. We found that V1 population responses in the period leading to the decision correspond more closely to the monkeys report than to the visual stimulus. These results, together with a simple computational model that allows one to quantify the captured choice-related variability, suggest that most of this variability is present in V1 as additive noise, and that areas downstream to V1 contain relatively little independent choice-related variability.',\n",

This approach may be applicable to the brain, where speculations about quantum operations in consciousness and cognition have a long history.\\n\\nProton spins of bulk water, which most likely interfere with any brain function, can act as the known quantum systems. If an unknown mediator exists, then NMR methods based on multiple quantum coherence (MQC) can act as entanglement witness. However, there are doubts that todays NMR signals can contain quantum correlations in general, and specifically in the brain environment. Here, we used a witness protocol based on zero quantum coherence (ZQC) whereby we minimised the classical signals to circumvent the NMR detection limits for quantum correlation. For short repetitive periods, we found evoked signals in most parts of the brain, whereby the temporal appearance resembled heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs). We found that those signals had no correlates with any classical NMR contrast. Similar to HEPs, the evoked signal depended on conscious awareness. Consciousness-related or electrophysiological signals are unknown in NMR. Remarkably, these signals only appeared if the local properties of the magnetisation were reduced. Our findings suggest that we may have witnessed entanglement mediated by consciousness-related brain functions. Those brain functions must then operate non-classically, which would mean that consciousness is non-classical.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Humans and animals make predictions about the rewards they expect to receive in different situations. In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as value representations, and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive choice: the expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best option is selected. Secondly, they support learning: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. Whether these different functions are mediated by different neural representations remains an open question. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that computationally separates learning from choosing. We investigate the role of value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based cognition. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbations indicate that these representations do not directly drive choice. Instead, they signal expected reward information to a learning process elsewhere in the brain that updates choice mechanisms.',\n",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Midbrain dopamine neurons are essential for flexible control of adaptive behaviors. DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

A new precision center-out task was performed by rhesus macaques to test the hypothesis that cyclic, condition-independent neural activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) occurs not only during initial reaching movements but also during subsequent corrective movements. Corrective movements were observed to be discrete with time courses and bell-shaped speed profiles similar to the initial movements. Condition-independent cyclic neural trajectories were similar and repeated for initial and each additional corrective submovement. The phase of the cyclic condition-independent neural activity predicted the time of peak movement speed more accurately than regression of instantaneous firing rate, even when the subject made multiple corrective movements. Rather than being controlled as continuations of the initial reach, a discrete cycle of motor cortex activity encodes each corrective submovement.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDuring a precision center-out task, initial and subsequent corrective movements occur as discrete submovements with bell-shaped speed profiles. A cycle of condition-independent activity in primary motor cortex neuron populations corresponds to each submovement, such that the phase of this cyclic activity predicts the time of peak speeds--both initial and corrective. These submovements accompanied by cyclic neural activity offer important clues into how we successfully execute precise, corrective reaching movements and may have implications for optimizing control of brain-computer interfaces.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Reaching movements are known to have large condition-independent neural activity and cyclic neural dynamics. A new precision center-out task was performed by rhesus macaques to test the hypothesis that cyclic, condition-independent neural activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) occurs not only during initial reaching movements but also during subsequent corrective movements. Corrective movements were observed to be discrete with time courses and bell-shaped speed profiles similar to the initial movements. Condition-independent cyclic neural trajectories were similar and repeated for initial and each additional corrective submovement. The phase of the cyclic condition-independent neural activity predicted the time of peak movement speed more accurately than regression of instantaneous firing rate, even when the subject made multiple corrective movements. Rather than being controlled as continuations of the initial reach, a discrete cycle of motor cortex activity encodes each corrective submovement.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDuring a precision center-out task, initial and subsequent corrective movements occur as discrete submovements with bell-shaped speed profiles. A cycle of condition-independent activity in primary motor cortex neuron populations corresponds to each submovement, such that the phase of this cyclic activity predicts the time of peak speeds--both initial and corrective. These submovements accompanied by cyclic neural activity offer important clues into how we successfully execute precise, corrective reaching movements and may have implications for optimizing control of brain-computer interfaces.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety/stressor disorders frequently co-occur and this dual diagnosis represents a major health and economic problem worldwide. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges.

This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains. Here, we charted the performance of 4-12- year-olds in six coordinative tasks that are all based on a common experimental paradigm but address three different sensorimotor-cognitive domains.

Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

We intravitreally injected agonists HU-210 (cannabinoid receptor-1) and IL-6 (interleukin 6 receptor) to stimulate retinal ganglion cells for axonal growth. We applied, in gel foam at the site of nerve injury, Taxol to stabilize growing microtubules, and activated protein C to clear the debris field since computational models predicted that this drug combination regulating two subcellular processes at the growth cone produces synergistic growth. Morphology experiments show that the four-drug combination promotes axonal regrowth to the optic chiasm and beyond.

Participants responses used both memory and sensory information, in accordance to their relative reliability. Formal model comparison showed that the sensory inference was best explained when its parameters were set dynamically at each trial by evidence sampled from memory.

       " 'abstract': 'The protease caspase-3 is a key mediator of apoptotic programmed cell death. But weak or transient caspase activity can contribute to neuronal differentiation, axonal pathfinding, and synaptic long-term depression. Despite the importance of sublethal, or nonapoptotic, caspase activity in neurodevelopment and neural plasticity, there has been no simple method for mapping and quantifying nonapoptotic caspase activity in rodent brains. We therefore generated a transgenic mouse expressing a highly sensitive and specific fluorescent reporter of caspase activity, with peak signal localized to the nucleus. As a proof of concept, we first obtained evidence that nonapoptotic caspase activity influences neurophysiology in an amygdalar circuit. Then focusing on the amygdala, we were able to quantify a sex-specific persistent elevation in caspase activity in females after restraint stress. This simple in vivo caspase activity reporter will facilitate systems-level studies of apoptotic and nonapoptotic phenomena in behavioral and pathological models.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCaspase-3 is an enzyme that can cause cell death when highly active but can also perform important cellular functions, such as maturation and structural changes, when only weakly or transiently active. Despite the importance of this nonlethal type of caspase activity, there is no straightforward method to measure it in live rodents. We therefore developed mice that have a fluorescent reporter that is sensitive enough to detect nonlethal caspase activity. Surprisingly, we found that weak caspase activity influences the synchrony of neuronal firing across different brain regions. We also observed increased caspase activity in female mice after severe stress. This simple caspase activity reporter can subserve multiple applications in behavior and pathology research.',\n",

This perceptual variability is presumably caused by neural variability in our brains. How much of the neural variability that correlates with the perceptual variability is present in the primary visual cortex (V1), the first cortical processing stage of visual information? To address this question, we recorded neural population responses from V1 using voltage-sensitive dye imaging while monkeys performed a challenging reaction-time visual detection task. We found that V1 population responses in the period leading to the decision correspond more closely to the monkeys report than to the visual stimulus.

This approach may be applicable to the brain, where speculations about quantum operations in consciousness and cognition have a long history.\\n\\nProton spins of bulk water, which most likely interfere with any brain function, can act as the known quantum systems. If an unknown mediator exists, then NMR methods based on multiple quantum coherence (MQC) can act as entanglement witness. However, there are doubts that todays NMR signals can contain quantum correlations in general, and specifically in the brain environment. Here, we used a witness protocol based on zero quantum coherence (ZQC) whereby we minimised the classical signals to circumvent the NMR detection limits for quantum correlation. For short repetitive periods, we found evoked signals in most parts of the brain, whereby the temporal appearance resembled heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs). We found that those signals had no correlates with any classical NMR contrast. Similar to HEPs, the evoked signal depended on conscious awareness. Consciousness-related or electrophysiological signals are unknown in NMR. Remarkably, these signals only appeared if the local properties of the magnetisation were reduced. Our findings suggest that we may have witnessed entanglement mediated by consciousness-related brain functions. Those brain functions must then operate non-classically, which would mean that consciousness is non-classical.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Humans and animals make predictions about the rewards they expect to receive in different situations. In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as value representations, and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive choice: the expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best option is selected. Secondly, they support learning: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. Whether these different functions are mediated by different neural representations remains an open question. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that computationally separates learning from choosing. We investigate the role of value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based cognition. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbations indicate that these representations do not directly drive choice. Instead, they signal expected reward information to a learning process elsewhere in the brain that updates choice mechanisms.',\n",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron.

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells.

To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety/stressor disorders frequently co-occur and this dual diagnosis represents a major health and economic problem worldwide. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges. Here, we assessed coordinative abilities of 120 children aged 4-12 for the two hands or a hand with another sensory signal in multiple, highly comparable sensorimotor tasks. This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains. Here, we charted the performance of 4-12- year-olds in six coordinative tasks that are all based on a common experimental paradigm but address three different sensorimotor-cognitive domains.

Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'There are no known drugs or drug combinations that promote substantial central nervous system axonal regeneration after injury. We used systems pharmacology approaches to model pathways underlying axonal growth and identify a four-drug combination that regulates multiple subcellular processes in the cell body and axon using the optic nerve crush model in rats. We intravitreally injected agonists HU-210 (cannabinoid receptor-1) and IL-6 (interleukin 6 receptor) to stimulate retinal ganglion cells for axonal growth. We applied, in gel foam at the site of nerve injury, Taxol to stabilize growing microtubules, and activated protein C to clear the debris field since computational models predicted that this drug combination regulating two subcellular processes at the growth cone produces synergistic growth. Morphology experiments show that the four-drug combination promotes axonal regrowth to the optic chiasm and beyond. Physiologically, drug treatment restored pattern electroretinograms and some of the animals had detectable visual evoked potentials in the brain and behavioral optokinetic responses. We conclude that spatially targeted drug treatment can promote robust axonal regeneration and can restore limited functional recovery.',\n",

Parkinsons disease is characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons and the emergence of strong {beta}-band (15-35Hz) oscillations throughout the basal ganglia nuclei. Here we combine experimental stimulation data from ten studies, that reveal the timing of excitatory and inhibitory events in the basal ganglia circuit, to estimate its set of transmission delays. In doing so, we reveal possible inconsistencies in the existing data, calling for replications, and we propose two possible sets of transmission delays.\\n\\nWe then integrate these delays in a model of the primate basal ganglia, that does not rely on direct and indirect pathways segregation, and show that, while much attention has been given to the role of the striatal dopaminergic receptors in Parkinsons disease symptoms, extrastriatal dopaminergic depletion in the external part of the globus pallidus and in the subthalamic nucleus is sufficient to generate {beta}-band oscillations in the high part of the band. More specifically, we show that that D2 and D5 dopamine receptors in these nuclei play opposing roles in the emergence of {beta}-band oscillations, thereby explaining how completely deactivating D5 receptors in the subthalamic nucleus can, paradoxically, cancel oscillations.',\n",

Participants performed a cue-guided perceptual decision task with independently-varying memory and sensory evidence. Cues established expectations by reminding participants of past stimulus-stimulus pairings, which predicted the likely target in a subsequent noisy image stream. Participants responses used both memory and sensory information, in accordance to their relative reliability. Formal model comparison showed that the sensory inference was best explained when its parameters were set dynamically at each trial by evidence sampled from memory. Supporting this model, neural pattern analysis revealed that responses to the probe were modulated by the specific content and fidelity of memory reinstatement that occurred before the probe appeared. Together, these results suggest that perceptual decisions arise from the continuous sampling of memory and sensory evidence.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The protease caspase-3 is a key mediator of apoptotic programmed cell death. But weak or transient caspase activity can contribute to neuronal differentiation, axonal pathfinding, and synaptic long-term depression. Despite the importance of sublethal, or nonapoptotic, caspase activity in neurodevelopment and neural plasticity, there has been no simple method for mapping and quantifying nonapoptotic caspase activity in rodent brains. We therefore generated a transgenic mouse expressing a highly sensitive and specific fluorescent reporter of caspase activity, with peak signal localized to the nucleus. As a proof of concept, we first obtained evidence that nonapoptotic caspase activity influences neurophysiology in an amygdalar circuit. Then focusing on the amygdala, we were able to quantify a sex-specific persistent elevation in caspase activity in females after restraint stress. This simple in vivo caspase activity reporter will facilitate systems-level studies of apoptotic and nonapoptotic phenomena in behavioral and pathological models.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCaspase-3 is an enzyme that can cause cell death when highly active but can also perform important cellular functions, such as maturation and structural changes, when only weakly or transiently active. Despite the importance of this nonlethal type of caspase activity, there is no straightforward method to measure it in live rodents. We therefore developed mice that have a fluorescent reporter that is sensitive enough to detect nonlethal caspase activity. Surprisingly, we found that weak caspase activity influences the synchrony of neuronal firing across different brain regions. We also observed increased caspase activity in female mice after severe stress. This simple caspase activity reporter can subserve multiple applications in behavior and pathology research.',\n",

This perceptual variability is presumably caused by neural variability in our brains. How much of the neural variability that correlates with the perceptual variability is present in the primary visual cortex (V1), the first cortical processing stage of visual information? To address this question, we recorded neural population responses from V1 using voltage-sensitive dye imaging while monkeys performed a challenging reaction-time visual detection task. We found that V1 population responses in the period leading to the decision correspond more closely to the monkeys report than to the visual stimulus. These results, together with a simple computational model that allows one to quantify the captured choice-related variability, suggest that most of this variability is present in V1 as additive noise, and that areas downstream to V1 contain relatively little independent choice-related variability.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Recent proposals in quantum gravity have suggested that unknown systems can mediate entanglement between two known quantum systems, if and only if the mediator itself is non-classical. This approach may be applicable to the brain, where speculations about quantum operations in consciousness and cognition have a long history.\\n\\nProton spins of bulk water, which most likely interfere with any brain function, can act as the known quantum systems. If an unknown mediator exists, then NMR methods based on multiple quantum coherence (MQC) can act as entanglement witness. However, there are doubts that todays NMR signals can contain quantum correlations in general, and specifically in the brain environment. Here, we used a witness protocol based on zero quantum coherence (ZQC) whereby we minimised the classical signals to circumvent the NMR detection limits for quantum correlation. For short repetitive periods, we found evoked signals in most parts of the brain, whereby the temporal appearance resembled heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs). We found that those signals had no correlates with any classical NMR contrast. Similar to HEPs, the evoked signal depended on conscious awareness. Consciousness-related or electrophysiological signals are unknown in NMR. Remarkably, these signals only appeared if the local properties of the magnetisation were reduced. Our findings suggest that we may have witnessed entanglement mediated by consciousness-related brain functions. Those brain functions must then operate non-classically, which would mean that consciousness is non-classical.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Humans and animals make predictions about the rewards they expect to receive in different situations. In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as value representations, and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive choice: the expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best option is selected. Secondly, they support learning: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. Whether these different functions are mediated by different neural representations remains an open question. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that computationally separates learning from choosing. We investigate the role of value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based cognition. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbations indicate that these representations do not directly drive choice. Instead, they signal expected reward information to a learning process elsewhere in the brain that updates choice mechanisms.',\n",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease.

Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization.

We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors.

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The organizational principles of glia remain largely unknown despite their vital role in nervous system function. Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Monosynaptic tracing using rabies virus is an important technique in neuroscience, allowing brain- wide labeling of neurons directly presynaptic to a targeted neuronal population. A 2017 article reported development of a noncytotoxic version - a major advance - based on attenuating the rabies virus by addition of a destabilization domain to the C-terminus of a viral protein. However, this modification did not appear to hinder the ability of the virus to spread between neurons. We analyzed two viruses provided by the authors and show here that both were mutants that had lost the intended modification, explaining the papers paradoxical results. We then made a virus that actually did have the intended modification in at least the majority of virions and found that it did not spread efficiently under the conditions described in the original paper, namely, without an exogenous protease being expressed in order to remove the destabilization domain. We found that it did spread when the protease was supplied, although this also appeared to result in the deaths of most source cells by three weeks postinjection. We conclude that the new approach is not robust but that it could become a viable technique given further optimization and validation.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTRabies virus, which spreads between synaptically-connected neurons, has been one of the primary tools used by neuroscientists to reveal the organization of the brain. A new modification to rabies virus was recently reported to allow the mapping of connected neurons without adverse effects on the cells health, unlike earlier versions. Here we show that the conclusions of that study were probably incorrect and based on having used viruses that had lost the intended modification because of mutations. We also show that a rabies virus that does retain the intended modification does not spread efficiently between neurons under the conditions reported previously; however, it does spread between neurons under different conditions, suggesting that the approach may be successful if refined further.',\n",

A 2017 article reported development of a noncytotoxic version - a major advance - based on attenuating the rabies virus by addition of a destabilization domain to the C-terminus of a viral protein. However, this modification did not appear to hinder the ability of the virus to spread between neurons. We analyzed two viruses provided by the authors and show here that both were mutants that had lost the intended modification, explaining the papers paradoxical results. We then made a virus that actually did have the intended modification in at least the majority of virions and found that it did not spread efficiently under the conditions described in the original paper, namely, without an exogenous protease being expressed in order to remove the destabilization domain. We found that it did spread when the protease was supplied, although this also appeared to result in the deaths of most source cells by three weeks postinjection. We conclude that the new approach is not robust but that it could become a viable technique given further optimization and validation.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTRabies virus, which spreads between synaptically-connected neurons, has been one of the primary tools used by neuroscientists to reveal the organization of the brain. A new modification to rabies virus was recently reported to allow the mapping of connected neurons without adverse effects on the cells health, unlike earlier versions. Here we show that the conclusions of that study were probably incorrect and based on having used viruses that had lost the intended modification because of mutations. We also show that a rabies virus that does retain the intended modification does not spread efficiently between neurons under the conditions reported previously; however, it does spread between neurons under different conditions, suggesting that the approach may be successful if refined further.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Sensory and motor processes undergo massive developmental changes over at least a decade in human development. Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges. Here, we assessed coordinative abilities of 120 children aged 4-12 for the two hands or a hand with another sensory signal in multiple, highly comparable sensorimotor tasks. This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains. Here, we charted the performance of 4-12- year-olds in six coordinative tasks that are all based on a common experimental paradigm but address three different sensorimotor-cognitive domains. This approach characterizes dependencies between multiple aspects of cognitive modulation in the interplay of sensory integration and motor control.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'In developing brains, activity-dependent remodeling facilitates the formation of precise neuronal connectivity. Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'There are no known drugs or drug combinations that promote substantial central nervous system axonal regeneration after injury. We used systems pharmacology approaches to model pathways underlying axonal growth and identify a four-drug combination that regulates multiple subcellular processes in the cell body and axon using the optic nerve crush model in rats. We intravitreally injected agonists HU-210 (cannabinoid receptor-1) and IL-6 (interleukin 6 receptor) to stimulate retinal ganglion cells for axonal growth. We applied, in gel foam at the site of nerve injury, Taxol to stabilize growing microtubules, and activated protein C to clear the debris field since computational models predicted that this drug combination regulating two subcellular processes at the growth cone produces synergistic growth. Morphology experiments show that the four-drug combination promotes axonal regrowth to the optic chiasm and beyond. Physiologically, drug treatment restored pattern electroretinograms and some of the animals had detectable visual evoked potentials in the brain and behavioral optokinetic responses. We conclude that spatially targeted drug treatment can promote robust axonal regeneration and can restore limited functional recovery.',\n",

Parkinsons disease is characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons and the emergence of strong {beta}-band (15-35Hz) oscillations throughout the basal ganglia nuclei. Here we combine experimental stimulation data from ten studies, that reveal the timing of excitatory and inhibitory events in the basal ganglia circuit, to estimate its set of transmission delays. In doing so, we reveal possible inconsistencies in the existing data, calling for replications, and we propose two possible sets of transmission delays.\\n\\nWe then integrate these delays in a model of the primate basal ganglia, that does not rely on direct and indirect pathways segregation, and show that, while much attention has been given to the role of the striatal dopaminergic receptors in Parkinsons disease symptoms, extrastriatal dopaminergic depletion in the external part of the globus pallidus and in the subthalamic nucleus is sufficient to generate {beta}-band oscillations in the high part of the band. More specifically, we show that that D2 and D5 dopamine receptors in these nuclei play opposing roles in the emergence of {beta}-band oscillations, thereby explaining how completely deactivating D5 receptors in the subthalamic nucleus can, paradoxically, cancel oscillations.',\n",

Participants performed a cue-guided perceptual decision task with independently-varying memory and sensory evidence. Cues established expectations by reminding participants of past stimulus-stimulus pairings, which predicted the likely target in a subsequent noisy image stream. Participants responses used both memory and sensory information, in accordance to their relative reliability. Formal model comparison showed that the sensory inference was best explained when its parameters were set dynamically at each trial by evidence sampled from memory. Supporting this model, neural pattern analysis revealed that responses to the probe were modulated by the specific content and fidelity of memory reinstatement that occurred before the probe appeared.

       " 'abstract': 'The protease caspase-3 is a key mediator of apoptotic programmed cell death. But weak or transient caspase activity can contribute to neuronal differentiation, axonal pathfinding, and synaptic long-term depression. Despite the importance of sublethal, or nonapoptotic, caspase activity in neurodevelopment and neural plasticity, there has been no simple method for mapping and quantifying nonapoptotic caspase activity in rodent brains. We therefore generated a transgenic mouse expressing a highly sensitive and specific fluorescent reporter of caspase activity, with peak signal localized to the nucleus. As a proof of concept, we first obtained evidence that nonapoptotic caspase activity influences neurophysiology in an amygdalar circuit. Then focusing on the amygdala, we were able to quantify a sex-specific persistent elevation in caspase activity in females after restraint stress. This simple in vivo caspase activity reporter will facilitate systems-level studies of apoptotic and nonapoptotic phenomena in behavioral and pathological models.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCaspase-3 is an enzyme that can cause cell death when highly active but can also perform important cellular functions, such as maturation and structural changes, when only weakly or transiently active. Despite the importance of this nonlethal type of caspase activity, there is no straightforward method to measure it in live rodents. We therefore developed mice that have a fluorescent reporter that is sensitive enough to detect nonlethal caspase activity. Surprisingly, we found that weak caspase activity influences the synchrony of neuronal firing across different brain regions. We also observed increased caspase activity in female mice after severe stress. This simple caspase activity reporter can subserve multiple applications in behavior and pathology research.',\n",

This perceptual variability is presumably caused by neural variability in our brains.

To address this question, we recorded neural population responses from V1 using voltage-sensitive dye imaging while monkeys performed a challenging reaction-time visual detection task. We found that V1 population responses in the period leading to the decision correspond more closely to the monkeys report than to the visual stimulus. These results, together with a simple computational model that allows one to quantify the captured choice-related variability, suggest that most of this variability is present in V1 as additive noise, and that areas downstream to V1 contain relatively little independent choice-related variability.',\n",

This approach may be applicable to the brain, where speculations about quantum operations in consciousness and cognition have a long history.\\n\\nProton spins of bulk water, which most likely interfere with any brain function, can act as the known quantum systems. If an unknown mediator exists, then NMR methods based on multiple quantum coherence (MQC) can act as entanglement witness. However, there are doubts that todays NMR signals can contain quantum correlations in general, and specifically in the brain environment. Here, we used a witness protocol based on zero quantum coherence (ZQC) whereby we minimised the classical signals to circumvent the NMR detection limits for quantum correlation. For short repetitive periods, we found evoked signals in most parts of the brain, whereby the temporal appearance resembled heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs). We found that those signals had no correlates with any classical NMR contrast. Similar to HEPs, the evoked signal depended on conscious awareness. Consciousness-related or electrophysiological signals are unknown in NMR. Remarkably, these signals only appeared if the local properties of the magnetisation were reduced. Our findings suggest that we may have witnessed entanglement mediated by consciousness-related brain functions. Those brain functions must then operate non-classically, which would mean that consciousness is non-classical.',\n",

In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as value representations, and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive choice: the expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best option is selected. Secondly, they support learning: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. Whether these different functions are mediated by different neural representations remains an open question. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that computationally separates learning from choosing. We investigate the role of value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based cognition. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbations indicate that these representations do not directly drive choice.

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease.

Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Midbrain dopamine neurons are essential for flexible control of adaptive behaviors. DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The organizational principles of glia remain largely unknown despite their vital role in nervous system function. Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety/stressor disorders frequently co-occur and this dual diagnosis represents a major health and economic problem worldwide. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Sensory and motor processes undergo massive developmental changes over at least a decade in human development. Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges. Here, we assessed coordinative abilities of 120 children aged 4-12 for the two hands or a hand with another sensory signal in multiple, highly comparable sensorimotor tasks. This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains. Here, we charted the performance of 4-12- year-olds in six coordinative tasks that are all based on a common experimental paradigm but address three different sensorimotor-cognitive domains. This approach characterizes dependencies between multiple aspects of cognitive modulation in the interplay of sensory integration and motor control.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'In developing brains, activity-dependent remodeling facilitates the formation of precise neuronal connectivity. Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'There are no known drugs or drug combinations that promote substantial central nervous system axonal regeneration after injury. We used systems pharmacology approaches to model pathways underlying axonal growth and identify a four-drug combination that regulates multiple subcellular processes in the cell body and axon using the optic nerve crush model in rats. We intravitreally injected agonists HU-210 (cannabinoid receptor-1) and IL-6 (interleukin 6 receptor) to stimulate retinal ganglion cells for axonal growth. We applied, in gel foam at the site of nerve injury, Taxol to stabilize growing microtubules, and activated protein C to clear the debris field since computational models predicted that this drug combination regulating two subcellular processes at the growth cone produces synergistic growth. Morphology experiments show that the four-drug combination promotes axonal regrowth to the optic chiasm and beyond. Physiologically, drug treatment restored pattern electroretinograms and some of the animals had detectable visual evoked potentials in the brain and behavioral optokinetic responses. We conclude that spatially targeted drug treatment can promote robust axonal regeneration and can restore limited functional recovery.',\n",

Parkinsons disease is characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons and the emergence of strong {beta}-band (15-35Hz) oscillations throughout the basal ganglia nuclei. Here we combine experimental stimulation data from ten studies, that reveal the timing of excitatory and inhibitory events in the basal ganglia circuit, to estimate its set of transmission delays. In doing so, we reveal possible inconsistencies in the existing data, calling for replications, and we propose two possible sets of transmission delays.\\n\\nWe then integrate these delays in a model of the primate basal ganglia, that does not rely on direct and indirect pathways segregation, and show that, while much attention has been given to the role of the striatal dopaminergic receptors in Parkinsons disease symptoms, extrastriatal dopaminergic depletion in the external part of the globus pallidus and in the subthalamic nucleus is sufficient to generate {beta}-band oscillations in the high part of the band. More specifically, we show that that D2 and D5 dopamine receptors in these nuclei play opposing roles in the emergence of {beta}-band oscillations, thereby explaining how completely deactivating D5 receptors in the subthalamic nucleus can, paradoxically, cancel oscillations.',\n",

Cues established expectations by reminding participants of past stimulus-stimulus pairings, which predicted the likely target in a subsequent noisy image stream. Participants responses used both memory and sensory information, in accordance to their relative reliability. Formal model comparison showed that the sensory inference was best explained when its parameters were set dynamically at each trial by evidence sampled from memory. Supporting this model, neural pattern analysis revealed that responses to the probe were modulated by the specific content and fidelity of memory reinstatement that occurred before the probe appeared.

       " 'abstract': 'The protease caspase-3 is a key mediator of apoptotic programmed cell death. But weak or transient caspase activity can contribute to neuronal differentiation, axonal pathfinding, and synaptic long-term depression. Despite the importance of sublethal, or nonapoptotic, caspase activity in neurodevelopment and neural plasticity, there has been no simple method for mapping and quantifying nonapoptotic caspase activity in rodent brains. We therefore generated a transgenic mouse expressing a highly sensitive and specific fluorescent reporter of caspase activity, with peak signal localized to the nucleus. As a proof of concept, we first obtained evidence that nonapoptotic caspase activity influences neurophysiology in an amygdalar circuit. Then focusing on the amygdala, we were able to quantify a sex-specific persistent elevation in caspase activity in females after restraint stress. This simple in vivo caspase activity reporter will facilitate systems-level studies of apoptotic and nonapoptotic phenomena in behavioral and pathological models.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCaspase-3 is an enzyme that can cause cell death when highly active but can also perform important cellular functions, such as maturation and structural changes, when only weakly or transiently active. Despite the importance of this nonlethal type of caspase activity, there is no straightforward method to measure it in live rodents. We therefore developed mice that have a fluorescent reporter that is sensitive enough to detect nonlethal caspase activity. Surprisingly, we found that weak caspase activity influences the synchrony of neuronal firing across different brain regions. We also observed increased caspase activity in female mice after severe stress. This simple caspase activity reporter can subserve multiple applications in behavior and pathology research.',\n",

This perceptual variability is presumably caused by neural variability in our brains. How much of the neural variability that correlates with the perceptual variability is present in the primary visual cortex (V1), the first cortical processing stage of visual information? To address this question, we recorded neural population responses from V1 using voltage-sensitive dye imaging while monkeys performed a challenging reaction-time visual detection task. We found that V1 population responses in the period leading to the decision correspond more closely to the monkeys report than to the visual stimulus. These results, together with a simple computational model that allows one to quantify the captured choice-related variability, suggest that most of this variability is present in V1 as additive noise, and that areas downstream to V1 contain relatively little independent choice-related variability.',\n",

This approach may be applicable to the brain, where speculations about quantum operations in consciousness and cognition have a long history.\\n\\nProton spins of bulk water, which most likely interfere with any brain function, can act as the known quantum systems. If an unknown mediator exists, then NMR methods based on multiple quantum coherence (MQC) can act as entanglement witness. However, there are doubts that todays NMR signals can contain quantum correlations in general, and specifically in the brain environment. Here, we used a witness protocol based on zero quantum coherence (ZQC) whereby we minimised the classical signals to circumvent the NMR detection limits for quantum correlation. For short repetitive periods, we found evoked signals in most parts of the brain, whereby the temporal appearance resembled heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs). We found that those signals had no correlates with any classical NMR contrast. Similar to HEPs, the evoked signal depended on conscious awareness. Consciousness-related or electrophysiological signals are unknown in NMR. Remarkably, these signals only appeared if the local properties of the magnetisation were reduced. Our findings suggest that we may have witnessed entanglement mediated by consciousness-related brain functions. Those brain functions must then operate non-classically, which would mean that consciousness is non-classical.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Humans and animals make predictions about the rewards they expect to receive in different situations. In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as value representations, and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive choice: the expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best option is selected. Secondly, they support learning: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. Whether these different functions are mediated by different neural representations remains an open question. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that computationally separates learning from choosing. We investigate the role of value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based cognition. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbations indicate that these representations do not directly drive choice. Instead, they signal expected reward information to a learning process elsewhere in the brain that updates choice mechanisms.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'AbstractEarly and economical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is pivotal for therapeutic efficacy, particularly for the settings where medical imaging resource is deficient. We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'What is the relationship between language and complex thought? In the context of deductive reasoning there are two main views. Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Midbrain dopamine neurons are essential for flexible control of adaptive behaviors. DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

A cycle of condition-independent activity in primary motor cortex neuron populations corresponds to each submovement, such that the phase of this cyclic activity predicts the time of peak speeds--both initial and corrective. These submovements accompanied by cyclic neural activity offer important clues into how we successfully execute precise, corrective reaching movements and may have implications for optimizing control of brain-computer interfaces.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety/stressor disorders frequently co-occur and this dual diagnosis represents a major health and economic problem worldwide. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges.

This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains. Here, we charted the performance of 4-12- year-olds in six coordinative tasks that are all based on a common experimental paradigm but address three different sensorimotor-cognitive domains.

Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

We intravitreally injected agonists HU-210 (cannabinoid receptor-1) and IL-6 (interleukin 6 receptor) to stimulate retinal ganglion cells for axonal growth. We applied, in gel foam at the site of nerve injury, Taxol to stabilize growing microtubules, and activated protein C to clear the debris field since computational models predicted that this drug combination regulating two subcellular processes at the growth cone produces synergistic growth. Morphology experiments show that the four-drug combination promotes axonal regrowth to the optic chiasm and beyond.

Participants responses used both memory and sensory information, in accordance to their relative reliability. Formal model comparison showed that the sensory inference was best explained when its parameters were set dynamically at each trial by evidence sampled from memory.

       " 'abstract': 'The protease caspase-3 is a key mediator of apoptotic programmed cell death. But weak or transient caspase activity can contribute to neuronal differentiation, axonal pathfinding, and synaptic long-term depression. Despite the importance of sublethal, or nonapoptotic, caspase activity in neurodevelopment and neural plasticity, there has been no simple method for mapping and quantifying nonapoptotic caspase activity in rodent brains. We therefore generated a transgenic mouse expressing a highly sensitive and specific fluorescent reporter of caspase activity, with peak signal localized to the nucleus. As a proof of concept, we first obtained evidence that nonapoptotic caspase activity influences neurophysiology in an amygdalar circuit. Then focusing on the amygdala, we were able to quantify a sex-specific persistent elevation in caspase activity in females after restraint stress. This simple in vivo caspase activity reporter will facilitate systems-level studies of apoptotic and nonapoptotic phenomena in behavioral and pathological models.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCaspase-3 is an enzyme that can cause cell death when highly active but can also perform important cellular functions, such as maturation and structural changes, when only weakly or transiently active. Despite the importance of this nonlethal type of caspase activity, there is no straightforward method to measure it in live rodents. We therefore developed mice that have a fluorescent reporter that is sensitive enough to detect nonlethal caspase activity. Surprisingly, we found that weak caspase activity influences the synchrony of neuronal firing across different brain regions. We also observed increased caspase activity in female mice after severe stress. This simple caspase activity reporter can subserve multiple applications in behavior and pathology research.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'While performing challenging perceptual tasks such as detecting a barely visible target, our perceptual reports vary across presentations of identical stimuli. This perceptual variability is presumably caused by neural variability in our brains. How much of the neural variability that correlates with the perceptual variability is present in the primary visual cortex (V1), the first cortical processing stage of visual information? To address this question, we recorded neural population responses from V1 using voltage-sensitive dye imaging while monkeys performed a challenging reaction-time visual detection task. We found that V1 population responses in the period leading to the decision correspond more closely to the monkeys report than to the visual stimulus. These results, together with a simple computational model that allows one to quantify the captured choice-related variability, suggest that most of this variability is present in V1 as additive noise, and that areas downstream to V1 contain relatively little independent choice-related variability.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Recent proposals in quantum gravity have suggested that unknown systems can mediate entanglement between two known quantum systems, if and only if the mediator itself is non-classical. This approach may be applicable to the brain, where speculations about quantum operations in consciousness and cognition have a long history.\\n\\nProton spins of bulk water, which most likely interfere with any brain function, can act as the known quantum systems. If an unknown mediator exists, then NMR methods based on multiple quantum coherence (MQC) can act as entanglement witness. However, there are doubts that todays NMR signals can contain quantum correlations in general, and specifically in the brain environment. Here, we used a witness protocol based on zero quantum coherence (ZQC) whereby we minimised the classical signals to circumvent the NMR detection limits for quantum correlation. For short repetitive periods, we found evoked signals in most parts of the brain, whereby the temporal appearance resembled heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs). We found that those signals had no correlates with any classical NMR contrast. Similar to HEPs, the evoked signal depended on conscious awareness. Consciousness-related or electrophysiological signals are unknown in NMR. Remarkably, these signals only appeared if the local properties of the magnetisation were reduced. Our findings suggest that we may have witnessed entanglement mediated by consciousness-related brain functions. Those brain functions must then operate non-classically, which would mean that consciousness is non-classical.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Humans and animals make predictions about the rewards they expect to receive in different situations. In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as value representations, and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive choice: the expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best option is selected. Secondly, they support learning: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. Whether these different functions are mediated by different neural representations remains an open question. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that computationally separates learning from choosing. We investigate the role of value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based cognition. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbations indicate that these representations do not directly drive choice. Instead, they signal expected reward information to a learning process elsewhere in the brain that updates choice mechanisms.',\n",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells.

Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety/stressor disorders frequently co-occur and this dual diagnosis represents a major health and economic problem worldwide. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges.

This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains.

Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

In doing so, we reveal possible inconsistencies in the existing data, calling for replications, and we propose two possible sets of transmission delays.\\n\\nWe then integrate these delays in a model of the primate basal ganglia, that does not rely on direct and indirect pathways segregation, and show that, while much attention has been given to the role of the striatal dopaminergic receptors in Parkinsons disease symptoms, extrastriatal dopaminergic depletion in the external part of the globus pallidus and in the subthalamic nucleus is sufficient to generate {beta}-band oscillations in the high part of the band. More specifically, we show that that D2 and D5 dopamine receptors in these nuclei play opposing roles in the emergence of {beta}-band oscillations, thereby explaining how completely deactivating D5 receptors in the subthalamic nucleus can, paradoxically, cancel oscillations.',\n",

Participants performed a cue-guided perceptual decision task with independently-varying memory and sensory evidence. Cues established expectations by reminding participants of past stimulus-stimulus pairings, which predicted the likely target in a subsequent noisy image stream. Participants responses used both memory and sensory information, in accordance to their relative reliability. Formal model comparison showed that the sensory inference was best explained when its parameters were set dynamically at each trial by evidence sampled from memory. Supporting this model, neural pattern analysis revealed that responses to the probe were modulated by the specific content and fidelity of memory reinstatement that occurred before the probe appeared.

       " 'abstract': 'The protease caspase-3 is a key mediator of apoptotic programmed cell death. But weak or transient caspase activity can contribute to neuronal differentiation, axonal pathfinding, and synaptic long-term depression. Despite the importance of sublethal, or nonapoptotic, caspase activity in neurodevelopment and neural plasticity, there has been no simple method for mapping and quantifying nonapoptotic caspase activity in rodent brains. We therefore generated a transgenic mouse expressing a highly sensitive and specific fluorescent reporter of caspase activity, with peak signal localized to the nucleus. As a proof of concept, we first obtained evidence that nonapoptotic caspase activity influences neurophysiology in an amygdalar circuit. Then focusing on the amygdala, we were able to quantify a sex-specific persistent elevation in caspase activity in females after restraint stress. This simple in vivo caspase activity reporter will facilitate systems-level studies of apoptotic and nonapoptotic phenomena in behavioral and pathological models.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCaspase-3 is an enzyme that can cause cell death when highly active but can also perform important cellular functions, such as maturation and structural changes, when only weakly or transiently active. Despite the importance of this nonlethal type of caspase activity, there is no straightforward method to measure it in live rodents. We therefore developed mice that have a fluorescent reporter that is sensitive enough to detect nonlethal caspase activity. Surprisingly, we found that weak caspase activity influences the synchrony of neuronal firing across different brain regions. We also observed increased caspase activity in female mice after severe stress. This simple caspase activity reporter can subserve multiple applications in behavior and pathology research.',\n",

This perceptual variability is presumably caused by neural variability in our brains. How much of the neural variability that correlates with the perceptual variability is present in the primary visual cortex (V1), the first cortical processing stage of visual information? To address this question, we recorded neural population responses from V1 using voltage-sensitive dye imaging while monkeys performed a challenging reaction-time visual detection task. We found that V1 population responses in the period leading to the decision correspond more closely to the monkeys report than to the visual stimulus.

This approach may be applicable to the brain, where speculations about quantum operations in consciousness and cognition have a long history.\\n\\nProton spins of bulk water, which most likely interfere with any brain function, can act as the known quantum systems. If an unknown mediator exists, then NMR methods based on multiple quantum coherence (MQC) can act as entanglement witness. However, there are doubts that todays NMR signals can contain quantum correlations in general, and specifically in the brain environment. Here, we used a witness protocol based on zero quantum coherence (ZQC) whereby we minimised the classical signals to circumvent the NMR detection limits for quantum correlation. For short repetitive periods, we found evoked signals in most parts of the brain, whereby the temporal appearance resembled heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs). We found that those signals had no correlates with any classical NMR contrast. Similar to HEPs, the evoked signal depended on conscious awareness. Consciousness-related or electrophysiological signals are unknown in NMR. Remarkably, these signals only appeared if the local properties of the magnetisation were reduced. Our findings suggest that we may have witnessed entanglement mediated by consciousness-related brain functions. Those brain functions must then operate non-classically, which would mean that consciousness is non-classical.',\n",

In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as value representations, and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive choice: the expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best option is selected. Secondly, they support learning: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. Whether these different functions are mediated by different neural representations remains an open question. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that computationally separates learning from choosing. We investigate the role of value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based cognition. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbations indicate that these representations do not directly drive choice. Instead, they signal expected reward information to a learning process elsewhere in the brain that updates choice mechanisms.',\n",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors.

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The organizational principles of glia remain largely unknown despite their vital role in nervous system function. Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Sensory and motor processes undergo massive developmental changes over at least a decade in human development. Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges. Here, we assessed coordinative abilities of 120 children aged 4-12 for the two hands or a hand with another sensory signal in multiple, highly comparable sensorimotor tasks. This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last.

       " 'abstract': 'In developing brains, activity-dependent remodeling facilitates the formation of precise neuronal connectivity. Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

Participants performed a cue-guided perceptual decision task with independently-varying memory and sensory evidence. Cues established expectations by reminding participants of past stimulus-stimulus pairings, which predicted the likely target in a subsequent noisy image stream. Participants responses used both memory and sensory information, in accordance to their relative reliability. Formal model comparison showed that the sensory inference was best explained when its parameters were set dynamically at each trial by evidence sampled from memory. Supporting this model, neural pattern analysis revealed that responses to the probe were modulated by the specific content and fidelity of memory reinstatement that occurred before the probe appeared.

       " 'abstract': 'The protease caspase-3 is a key mediator of apoptotic programmed cell death. But weak or transient caspase activity can contribute to neuronal differentiation, axonal pathfinding, and synaptic long-term depression. Despite the importance of sublethal, or nonapoptotic, caspase activity in neurodevelopment and neural plasticity, there has been no simple method for mapping and quantifying nonapoptotic caspase activity in rodent brains. We therefore generated a transgenic mouse expressing a highly sensitive and specific fluorescent reporter of caspase activity, with peak signal localized to the nucleus. As a proof of concept, we first obtained evidence that nonapoptotic caspase activity influences neurophysiology in an amygdalar circuit. Then focusing on the amygdala, we were able to quantify a sex-specific persistent elevation in caspase activity in females after restraint stress. This simple in vivo caspase activity reporter will facilitate systems-level studies of apoptotic and nonapoptotic phenomena in behavioral and pathological models.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCaspase-3 is an enzyme that can cause cell death when highly active but can also perform important cellular functions, such as maturation and structural changes, when only weakly or transiently active. Despite the importance of this nonlethal type of caspase activity, there is no straightforward method to measure it in live rodents. We therefore developed mice that have a fluorescent reporter that is sensitive enough to detect nonlethal caspase activity. Surprisingly, we found that weak caspase activity influences the synchrony of neuronal firing across different brain regions. We also observed increased caspase activity in female mice after severe stress. This simple caspase activity reporter can subserve multiple applications in behavior and pathology research.',\n",

This perceptual variability is presumably caused by neural variability in our brains. How much of the neural variability that correlates with the perceptual variability is present in the primary visual cortex (V1), the first cortical processing stage of visual information? To address this question, we recorded neural population responses from V1 using voltage-sensitive dye imaging while monkeys performed a challenging reaction-time visual detection task. We found that V1 population responses in the period leading to the decision correspond more closely to the monkeys report than to the visual stimulus.

This approach may be applicable to the brain, where speculations about quantum operations in consciousness and cognition have a long history.\\n\\nProton spins of bulk water, which most likely interfere with any brain function, can act as the known quantum systems. If an unknown mediator exists, then NMR methods based on multiple quantum coherence (MQC) can act as entanglement witness. However, there are doubts that todays NMR signals can contain quantum correlations in general, and specifically in the brain environment. Here, we used a witness protocol based on zero quantum coherence (ZQC) whereby we minimised the classical signals to circumvent the NMR detection limits for quantum correlation. For short repetitive periods, we found evoked signals in most parts of the brain, whereby the temporal appearance resembled heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs). We found that those signals had no correlates with any classical NMR contrast. Similar to HEPs, the evoked signal depended on conscious awareness. Consciousness-related or electrophysiological signals are unknown in NMR. Remarkably, these signals only appeared if the local properties of the magnetisation were reduced. Our findings suggest that we may have witnessed entanglement mediated by consciousness-related brain functions. Those brain functions must then operate non-classically, which would mean that consciousness is non-classical.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Humans and animals make predictions about the rewards they expect to receive in different situations. In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as value representations, and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive choice: the expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best option is selected. Secondly, they support learning: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. Whether these different functions are mediated by different neural representations remains an open question. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that computationally separates learning from choosing. We investigate the role of value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based cognition. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbations indicate that these representations do not directly drive choice. Instead, they signal expected reward information to a learning process elsewhere in the brain that updates choice mechanisms.',\n",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease.

Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern.

We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors.

The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron.

Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The organizational principles of glia remain largely unknown despite their vital role in nervous system function. Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Sensory and motor processes undergo massive developmental changes over at least a decade in human development. Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges. Here, we assessed coordinative abilities of 120 children aged 4-12 for the two hands or a hand with another sensory signal in multiple, highly comparable sensorimotor tasks. This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains. Here, we charted the performance of 4-12- year-olds in six coordinative tasks that are all based on a common experimental paradigm but address three different sensorimotor-cognitive domains. This approach characterizes dependencies between multiple aspects of cognitive modulation in the interplay of sensory integration and motor control.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'In developing brains, activity-dependent remodeling facilitates the formation of precise neuronal connectivity. Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The protease caspase-3 is a key mediator of apoptotic programmed cell death. But weak or transient caspase activity can contribute to neuronal differentiation, axonal pathfinding, and synaptic long-term depression. Despite the importance of sublethal, or nonapoptotic, caspase activity in neurodevelopment and neural plasticity, there has been no simple method for mapping and quantifying nonapoptotic caspase activity in rodent brains. We therefore generated a transgenic mouse expressing a highly sensitive and specific fluorescent reporter of caspase activity, with peak signal localized to the nucleus. As a proof of concept, we first obtained evidence that nonapoptotic caspase activity influences neurophysiology in an amygdalar circuit. Then focusing on the amygdala, we were able to quantify a sex-specific persistent elevation in caspase activity in females after restraint stress. This simple in vivo caspase activity reporter will facilitate systems-level studies of apoptotic and nonapoptotic phenomena in behavioral and pathological models.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCaspase-3 is an enzyme that can cause cell death when highly active but can also perform important cellular functions, such as maturation and structural changes, when only weakly or transiently active. Despite the importance of this nonlethal type of caspase activity, there is no straightforward method to measure it in live rodents. We therefore developed mice that have a fluorescent reporter that is sensitive enough to detect nonlethal caspase activity. Surprisingly, we found that weak caspase activity influences the synchrony of neuronal firing across different brain regions. We also observed increased caspase activity in female mice after severe stress. This simple caspase activity reporter can subserve multiple applications in behavior and pathology research.',\n",

This perceptual variability is presumably caused by neural variability in our brains. How much of the neural variability that correlates with the perceptual variability is present in the primary visual cortex (V1), the first cortical processing stage of visual information? To address this question, we recorded neural population responses from V1 using voltage-sensitive dye imaging while monkeys performed a challenging reaction-time visual detection task. We found that V1 population responses in the period leading to the decision correspond more closely to the monkeys report than to the visual stimulus. These results, together with a simple computational model that allows one to quantify the captured choice-related variability, suggest that most of this variability is present in V1 as additive noise, and that areas downstream to V1 contain relatively little independent choice-related variability.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Recent proposals in quantum gravity have suggested that unknown systems can mediate entanglement between two known quantum systems, if and only if the mediator itself is non-classical. This approach may be applicable to the brain, where speculations about quantum operations in consciousness and cognition have a long history.\\n\\nProton spins of bulk water, which most likely interfere with any brain function, can act as the known quantum systems. If an unknown mediator exists, then NMR methods based on multiple quantum coherence (MQC) can act as entanglement witness. However, there are doubts that todays NMR signals can contain quantum correlations in general, and specifically in the brain environment. Here, we used a witness protocol based on zero quantum coherence (ZQC) whereby we minimised the classical signals to circumvent the NMR detection limits for quantum correlation. For short repetitive periods, we found evoked signals in most parts of the brain, whereby the temporal appearance resembled heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs). We found that those signals had no correlates with any classical NMR contrast. Similar to HEPs, the evoked signal depended on conscious awareness. Consciousness-related or electrophysiological signals are unknown in NMR. Remarkably, these signals only appeared if the local properties of the magnetisation were reduced. Our findings suggest that we may have witnessed entanglement mediated by consciousness-related brain functions. Those brain functions must then operate non-classically, which would mean that consciousness is non-classical.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Humans and animals make predictions about the rewards they expect to receive in different situations. In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as value representations, and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive choice: the expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best option is selected. Secondly, they support learning: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. Whether these different functions are mediated by different neural representations remains an open question. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that computationally separates learning from choosing. We investigate the role of value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based cognition. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbations indicate that these representations do not directly drive choice. Instead, they signal expected reward information to a learning process elsewhere in the brain that updates choice mechanisms.',\n",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization.

We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The organizational principles of glia remain largely unknown despite their vital role in nervous system function. Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety/stressor disorders frequently co-occur and this dual diagnosis represents a major health and economic problem worldwide. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains. Here, we charted the performance of 4-12- year-olds in six coordinative tasks that are all based on a common experimental paradigm but address three different sensorimotor-cognitive domains. This approach characterizes dependencies between multiple aspects of cognitive modulation in the interplay of sensory integration and motor control.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'In developing brains, activity-dependent remodeling facilitates the formation of precise neuronal connectivity. Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The protease caspase-3 is a key mediator of apoptotic programmed cell death. But weak or transient caspase activity can contribute to neuronal differentiation, axonal pathfinding, and synaptic long-term depression. Despite the importance of sublethal, or nonapoptotic, caspase activity in neurodevelopment and neural plasticity, there has been no simple method for mapping and quantifying nonapoptotic caspase activity in rodent brains. We therefore generated a transgenic mouse expressing a highly sensitive and specific fluorescent reporter of caspase activity, with peak signal localized to the nucleus. As a proof of concept, we first obtained evidence that nonapoptotic caspase activity influences neurophysiology in an amygdalar circuit. Then focusing on the amygdala, we were able to quantify a sex-specific persistent elevation in caspase activity in females after restraint stress. This simple in vivo caspase activity reporter will facilitate systems-level studies of apoptotic and nonapoptotic phenomena in behavioral and pathological models.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCaspase-3 is an enzyme that can cause cell death when highly active but can also perform important cellular functions, such as maturation and structural changes, when only weakly or transiently active. Despite the importance of this nonlethal type of caspase activity, there is no straightforward method to measure it in live rodents. We therefore developed mice that have a fluorescent reporter that is sensitive enough to detect nonlethal caspase activity. Surprisingly, we found that weak caspase activity influences the synchrony of neuronal firing across different brain regions. We also observed increased caspase activity in female mice after severe stress. This simple caspase activity reporter can subserve multiple applications in behavior and pathology research.',\n",

This perceptual variability is presumably caused by neural variability in our brains. How much of the neural variability that correlates with the perceptual variability is present in the primary visual cortex (V1), the first cortical processing stage of visual information? To address this question, we recorded neural population responses from V1 using voltage-sensitive dye imaging while monkeys performed a challenging reaction-time visual detection task. We found that V1 population responses in the period leading to the decision correspond more closely to the monkeys report than to the visual stimulus.

This approach may be applicable to the brain, where speculations about quantum operations in consciousness and cognition have a long history.\\n\\nProton spins of bulk water, which most likely interfere with any brain function, can act as the known quantum systems. If an unknown mediator exists, then NMR methods based on multiple quantum coherence (MQC) can act as entanglement witness. However, there are doubts that todays NMR signals can contain quantum correlations in general, and specifically in the brain environment. Here, we used a witness protocol based on zero quantum coherence (ZQC) whereby we minimised the classical signals to circumvent the NMR detection limits for quantum correlation. For short repetitive periods, we found evoked signals in most parts of the brain, whereby the temporal appearance resembled heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs). We found that those signals had no correlates with any classical NMR contrast. Similar to HEPs, the evoked signal depended on conscious awareness. Consciousness-related or electrophysiological signals are unknown in NMR. Remarkably, these signals only appeared if the local properties of the magnetisation were reduced. Our findings suggest that we may have witnessed entanglement mediated by consciousness-related brain functions. Those brain functions must then operate non-classically, which would mean that consciousness is non-classical.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Humans and animals make predictions about the rewards they expect to receive in different situations. In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as value representations, and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive choice: the expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best option is selected. Secondly, they support learning: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. Whether these different functions are mediated by different neural representations remains an open question. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that computationally separates learning from choosing. We investigate the role of value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based cognition. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbations indicate that these representations do not directly drive choice. Instead, they signal expected reward information to a learning process elsewhere in the brain that updates choice mechanisms.',\n",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization.

We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors.

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron.

Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The organizational principles of glia remain largely unknown despite their vital role in nervous system function. Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Sensory and motor processes undergo massive developmental changes over at least a decade in human development. Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges. Here, we assessed coordinative abilities of 120 children aged 4-12 for the two hands or a hand with another sensory signal in multiple, highly comparable sensorimotor tasks. This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal.

       " 'abstract': 'In developing brains, activity-dependent remodeling facilitates the formation of precise neuronal connectivity. Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Eye tracking studies suggest that refixations, fixations to locations previously visited, serve to recover information lost or missed during earlier exploration of a visual scene. These studies have largely ignored the role of precursor fixations, previous fixations on locations the eyes return to later. We consider the possibility that preparations to return later are already made during precursor fixations. This would mark precursor fixations as a special category of fixations, i.e., distinct in neural activity from other fixation categories such as refixations and fixations to locations visited only once. To capture the neural signals associated with fixation categories, we analyzed EEG and eye movement recorded simultaneously in a free-viewing contour search task. We developed a methodological pipeline involving regression-based deconvolution modeling, allowing our analyses to account for overlapping EEG responses due to the saccade sequence and other oculomotor covariates. We found that precursor fixations were preceded by the largest saccades among the fixation categories. Independently of the effect of saccade length, EEG amplitude was enhanced in precursor fixations compared to the other fixation categories 200-400 ms after fixation onsets, most noticeably over the occipital areas. We concluded that precursor fixations play a pivotal role in visual perception, marking the continuous occurrence of transitions between exploratory and exploitative modes of eye movement in natural viewing behavior.',\n",

This perceptual variability is presumably caused by neural variability in our brains. How much of the neural variability that correlates with the perceptual variability is present in the primary visual cortex (V1), the first cortical processing stage of visual information? To address this question, we recorded neural population responses from V1 using voltage-sensitive dye imaging while monkeys performed a challenging reaction-time visual detection task. We found that V1 population responses in the period leading to the decision correspond more closely to the monkeys report than to the visual stimulus. These results, together with a simple computational model that allows one to quantify the captured choice-related variability, suggest that most of this variability is present in V1 as additive noise, and that areas downstream to V1 contain relatively little independent choice-related variability.',\n",

This approach may be applicable to the brain, where speculations about quantum operations in consciousness and cognition have a long history.\\n\\nProton spins of bulk water, which most likely interfere with any brain function, can act as the known quantum systems. If an unknown mediator exists, then NMR methods based on multiple quantum coherence (MQC) can act as entanglement witness. However, there are doubts that todays NMR signals can contain quantum correlations in general, and specifically in the brain environment. Here, we used a witness protocol based on zero quantum coherence (ZQC) whereby we minimised the classical signals to circumvent the NMR detection limits for quantum correlation. For short repetitive periods, we found evoked signals in most parts of the brain, whereby the temporal appearance resembled heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs). We found that those signals had no correlates with any classical NMR contrast. Similar to HEPs, the evoked signal depended on conscious awareness. Consciousness-related or electrophysiological signals are unknown in NMR. Remarkably, these signals only appeared if the local properties of the magnetisation were reduced. Our findings suggest that we may have witnessed entanglement mediated by consciousness-related brain functions. Those brain functions must then operate non-classically, which would mean that consciousness is non-classical.',\n",

In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as value representations, and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive choice: the expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best option is selected. Secondly, they support learning: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. Whether these different functions are mediated by different neural representations remains an open question. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that computationally separates learning from choosing. We investigate the role of value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based cognition. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbations indicate that these representations do not directly drive choice.

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors.

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron.

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The organizational principles of glia remain largely unknown despite their vital role in nervous system function. Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety/stressor disorders frequently co-occur and this dual diagnosis represents a major health and economic problem worldwide. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges. Here, we assessed coordinative abilities of 120 children aged 4-12 for the two hands or a hand with another sensory signal in multiple, highly comparable sensorimotor tasks. This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains. Here, we charted the performance of 4-12- year-olds in six coordinative tasks that are all based on a common experimental paradigm but address three different sensorimotor-cognitive domains.

       " 'abstract': 'In developing brains, activity-dependent remodeling facilitates the formation of precise neuronal connectivity. Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

This perceptual variability is presumably caused by neural variability in our brains. How much of the neural variability that correlates with the perceptual variability is present in the primary visual cortex (V1), the first cortical processing stage of visual information? To address this question, we recorded neural population responses from V1 using voltage-sensitive dye imaging while monkeys performed a challenging reaction-time visual detection task. We found that V1 population responses in the period leading to the decision correspond more closely to the monkeys report than to the visual stimulus. These results, together with a simple computational model that allows one to quantify the captured choice-related variability, suggest that most of this variability is present in V1 as additive noise, and that areas downstream to V1 contain relatively little independent choice-related variability.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Recent proposals in quantum gravity have suggested that unknown systems can mediate entanglement between two known quantum systems, if and only if the mediator itself is non-classical. This approach may be applicable to the brain, where speculations about quantum operations in consciousness and cognition have a long history.\\n\\nProton spins of bulk water, which most likely interfere with any brain function, can act as the known quantum systems. If an unknown mediator exists, then NMR methods based on multiple quantum coherence (MQC) can act as entanglement witness. However, there are doubts that todays NMR signals can contain quantum correlations in general, and specifically in the brain environment. Here, we used a witness protocol based on zero quantum coherence (ZQC) whereby we minimised the classical signals to circumvent the NMR detection limits for quantum correlation. For short repetitive periods, we found evoked signals in most parts of the brain, whereby the temporal appearance resembled heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs). We found that those signals had no correlates with any classical NMR contrast. Similar to HEPs, the evoked signal depended on conscious awareness. Consciousness-related or electrophysiological signals are unknown in NMR. Remarkably, these signals only appeared if the local properties of the magnetisation were reduced. Our findings suggest that we may have witnessed entanglement mediated by consciousness-related brain functions. Those brain functions must then operate non-classically, which would mean that consciousness is non-classical.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Humans and animals make predictions about the rewards they expect to receive in different situations. In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as value representations, and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive choice: the expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best option is selected. Secondly, they support learning: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. Whether these different functions are mediated by different neural representations remains an open question. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that computationally separates learning from choosing. We investigate the role of value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based cognition. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbations indicate that these representations do not directly drive choice. Instead, they signal expected reward information to a learning process elsewhere in the brain that updates choice mechanisms.',\n",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors.

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The organizational principles of glia remain largely unknown despite their vital role in nervous system function. Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains. Here, we charted the performance of 4-12- year-olds in six coordinative tasks that are all based on a common experimental paradigm but address three different sensorimotor-cognitive domains. This approach characterizes dependencies between multiple aspects of cognitive modulation in the interplay of sensory integration and motor control.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'In developing brains, activity-dependent remodeling facilitates the formation of precise neuronal connectivity. Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

This perceptual variability is presumably caused by neural variability in our brains. How much of the neural variability that correlates with the perceptual variability is present in the primary visual cortex (V1), the first cortical processing stage of visual information? To address this question, we recorded neural population responses from V1 using voltage-sensitive dye imaging while monkeys performed a challenging reaction-time visual detection task. We found that V1 population responses in the period leading to the decision correspond more closely to the monkeys report than to the visual stimulus. These results, together with a simple computational model that allows one to quantify the captured choice-related variability, suggest that most of this variability is present in V1 as additive noise, and that areas downstream to V1 contain relatively little independent choice-related variability.',\n",

This approach may be applicable to the brain, where speculations about quantum operations in consciousness and cognition have a long history.\\n\\nProton spins of bulk water, which most likely interfere with any brain function, can act as the known quantum systems. If an unknown mediator exists, then NMR methods based on multiple quantum coherence (MQC) can act as entanglement witness. However, there are doubts that todays NMR signals can contain quantum correlations in general, and specifically in the brain environment. Here, we used a witness protocol based on zero quantum coherence (ZQC) whereby we minimised the classical signals to circumvent the NMR detection limits for quantum correlation. For short repetitive periods, we found evoked signals in most parts of the brain, whereby the temporal appearance resembled heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs). We found that those signals had no correlates with any classical NMR contrast. Similar to HEPs, the evoked signal depended on conscious awareness. Consciousness-related or electrophysiological signals are unknown in NMR. Remarkably, these signals only appeared if the local properties of the magnetisation were reduced. Our findings suggest that we may have witnessed entanglement mediated by consciousness-related brain functions. Those brain functions must then operate non-classically, which would mean that consciousness is non-classical.',\n",

In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as value representations, and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive choice: the expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best option is selected. Secondly, they support learning: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. Whether these different functions are mediated by different neural representations remains an open question. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that computationally separates learning from choosing. We investigate the role of value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based cognition. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbations indicate that these representations do not directly drive choice. Instead, they signal expected reward information to a learning process elsewhere in the brain that updates choice mechanisms.',\n",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease.

Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors.

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The organizational principles of glia remain largely unknown despite their vital role in nervous system function. Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Sensory and motor processes undergo massive developmental changes over at least a decade in human development. Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges. Here, we assessed coordinative abilities of 120 children aged 4-12 for the two hands or a hand with another sensory signal in multiple, highly comparable sensorimotor tasks. This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains. Here, we charted the performance of 4-12- year-olds in six coordinative tasks that are all based on a common experimental paradigm but address three different sensorimotor-cognitive domains. This approach characterizes dependencies between multiple aspects of cognitive modulation in the interplay of sensory integration and motor control.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'In developing brains, activity-dependent remodeling facilitates the formation of precise neuronal connectivity. Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'ObjectiveThe mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is one of the master coordinators of cellular stress responses, regulating metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis. We recently reported that Staufen1 (STAU1), a stress granule (SG) protein, was overabundant in fibroblast cell lines from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal degeneration, Huntingtons, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons diseases as well as animal models, and patient tissues. STAU1 overabundance is associated with mTOR hyperactivation and links SG formation with autophagy. Our objective was to determine the mechanism of mTOR regulation by STAU1.\\n\\nMethodsWe determined STAU1 abundance with disease- and chemical-induced cellular stressors in patient cells and animal models. We also used RNA binding assays to contextualize STAU1 interaction with MTOR mRNA.\\n\\nResultsSTAU1 and mTOR were overabundant in BAC-C9orf72, ATXN2Q127, and Thy1-TDP-43 transgenic mouse models. Reducing STAU1 levels in these mice normalized mTOR levels and activity and autophagy-related marker proteins. We also saw increased STAU1 levels in HEK293 cells transfected to express C9orf72-relevant dipeptide repeats (DPRs). Conversely, DPR accumulations were not observed in cells treated by STAU1 RNAi. Overexpression of STAU1 in HEK293 cells increased mTOR levels through direct MTOR mRNA interaction, activating downstream targets and impairing autophagic flux. Targeting mTOR by rapamycin or RNAi normalized STAU1 abundance in a SCA2 cellular model.\\n\\nInterpretationSTAU1 interaction with mTOR drives its hyperactivation and inhibits autophagic flux in multiple models of neurodegeneration. Staufen, therefore, constitutes a novel target to modulate mTOR activity, autophagy, and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",

This approach may be applicable to the brain, where speculations about quantum operations in consciousness and cognition have a long history.\\n\\nProton spins of bulk water, which most likely interfere with any brain function, can act as the known quantum systems. If an unknown mediator exists, then NMR methods based on multiple quantum coherence (MQC) can act as entanglement witness. However, there are doubts that todays NMR signals can contain quantum correlations in general, and specifically in the brain environment. Here, we used a witness protocol based on zero quantum coherence (ZQC) whereby we minimised the classical signals to circumvent the NMR detection limits for quantum correlation. For short repetitive periods, we found evoked signals in most parts of the brain, whereby the temporal appearance resembled heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs). We found that those signals had no correlates with any classical NMR contrast. Similar to HEPs, the evoked signal depended on conscious awareness. Consciousness-related or electrophysiological signals are unknown in NMR. Remarkably, these signals only appeared if the local properties of the magnetisation were reduced. Our findings suggest that we may have witnessed entanglement mediated by consciousness-related brain functions. Those brain functions must then operate non-classically, which would mean that consciousness is non-classical.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Humans and animals make predictions about the rewards they expect to receive in different situations. In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as value representations, and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive choice: the expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best option is selected. Secondly, they support learning: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. Whether these different functions are mediated by different neural representations remains an open question. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that computationally separates learning from choosing. We investigate the role of value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based cognition. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbations indicate that these representations do not directly drive choice. Instead, they signal expected reward information to a learning process elsewhere in the brain that updates choice mechanisms.',\n",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The organizational principles of glia remain largely unknown despite their vital role in nervous system function. Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Monosynaptic tracing using rabies virus is an important technique in neuroscience, allowing brain- wide labeling of neurons directly presynaptic to a targeted neuronal population. A 2017 article reported development of a noncytotoxic version - a major advance - based on attenuating the rabies virus by addition of a destabilization domain to the C-terminus of a viral protein. However, this modification did not appear to hinder the ability of the virus to spread between neurons. We analyzed two viruses provided by the authors and show here that both were mutants that had lost the intended modification, explaining the papers paradoxical results. We then made a virus that actually did have the intended modification in at least the majority of virions and found that it did not spread efficiently under the conditions described in the original paper, namely, without an exogenous protease being expressed in order to remove the destabilization domain. We found that it did spread when the protease was supplied, although this also appeared to result in the deaths of most source cells by three weeks postinjection. We conclude that the new approach is not robust but that it could become a viable technique given further optimization and validation.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTRabies virus, which spreads between synaptically-connected neurons, has been one of the primary tools used by neuroscientists to reveal the organization of the brain. A new modification to rabies virus was recently reported to allow the mapping of connected neurons without adverse effects on the cells health, unlike earlier versions. Here we show that the conclusions of that study were probably incorrect and based on having used viruses that had lost the intended modification because of mutations. We also show that a rabies virus that does retain the intended modification does not spread efficiently between neurons under the conditions reported previously; however, it does spread between neurons under different conditions, suggesting that the approach may be successful if refined further.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Monosynaptic tracing using rabies virus is an important technique in neuroscience, allowing brain- wide labeling of neurons directly presynaptic to a targeted neuronal population. A 2017 article reported development of a noncytotoxic version - a major advance - based on attenuating the rabies virus by addition of a destabilization domain to the C-terminus of a viral protein. However, this modification did not appear to hinder the ability of the virus to spread between neurons. We analyzed two viruses provided by the authors and show here that both were mutants that had lost the intended modification, explaining the papers paradoxical results. We then made a virus that actually did have the intended modification in at least the majority of virions and found that it did not spread efficiently under the conditions described in the original paper, namely, without an exogenous protease being expressed in order to remove the destabilization domain. We found that it did spread when the protease was supplied, although this also appeared to result in the deaths of most source cells by three weeks postinjection. We conclude that the new approach is not robust but that it could become a viable technique given further optimization and validation.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTRabies virus, which spreads between synaptically-connected neurons, has been one of the primary tools used by neuroscientists to reveal the organization of the brain. A new modification to rabies virus was recently reported to allow the mapping of connected neurons without adverse effects on the cells health, unlike earlier versions. Here we show that the conclusions of that study were probably incorrect and based on having used viruses that had lost the intended modification because of mutations. We also show that a rabies virus that does retain the intended modification does not spread efficiently between neurons under the conditions reported previously; however, it does spread between neurons under different conditions, suggesting that the approach may be successful if refined further.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Sensory and motor processes undergo massive developmental changes over at least a decade in human development. Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges. Here, we assessed coordinative abilities of 120 children aged 4-12 for the two hands or a hand with another sensory signal in multiple, highly comparable sensorimotor tasks. This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains. Here, we charted the performance of 4-12- year-olds in six coordinative tasks that are all based on a common experimental paradigm but address three different sensorimotor-cognitive domains. This approach characterizes dependencies between multiple aspects of cognitive modulation in the interplay of sensory integration and motor control.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'In developing brains, activity-dependent remodeling facilitates the formation of precise neuronal connectivity. Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'ObjectiveThe mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is one of the master coordinators of cellular stress responses, regulating metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis. We recently reported that Staufen1 (STAU1), a stress granule (SG) protein, was overabundant in fibroblast cell lines from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal degeneration, Huntingtons, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons diseases as well as animal models, and patient tissues. STAU1 overabundance is associated with mTOR hyperactivation and links SG formation with autophagy. Our objective was to determine the mechanism of mTOR regulation by STAU1.\\n\\nMethodsWe determined STAU1 abundance with disease- and chemical-induced cellular stressors in patient cells and animal models. We also used RNA binding assays to contextualize STAU1 interaction with MTOR mRNA.\\n\\nResultsSTAU1 and mTOR were overabundant in BAC-C9orf72, ATXN2Q127, and Thy1-TDP-43 transgenic mouse models. Reducing STAU1 levels in these mice normalized mTOR levels and activity and autophagy-related marker proteins. We also saw increased STAU1 levels in HEK293 cells transfected to express C9orf72-relevant dipeptide repeats (DPRs). Conversely, DPR accumulations were not observed in cells treated by STAU1 RNAi. Overexpression of STAU1 in HEK293 cells increased mTOR levels through direct MTOR mRNA interaction, activating downstream targets and impairing autophagic flux. Targeting mTOR by rapamycin or RNAi normalized STAU1 abundance in a SCA2 cellular model.\\n\\nInterpretationSTAU1 interaction with mTOR drives its hyperactivation and inhibits autophagic flux in multiple models of neurodegeneration. Staufen, therefore, constitutes a novel target to modulate mTOR activity, autophagy, and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Medial prefrontal cortex (mPfC) activity represents information about the state of the world, including present behaviour, such as decisions, and the immediate past, such as short-term memory. Unknown is whether information about different states of the world are represented in the same mPfC neural population and, if so, how they are kept distinct. To address this, we analyse here mPfC population activity of rats learning rules in a Y-maze, with self-initiated choice trials to an arm-end followed by a self-paced return during the inter-trial interval (ITI). We find that trial and ITI population activity from the same population fall into different low-dimensional subspaces. These subspaces encode different states of the world: multiple features of the task can be decoded from both trial and ITI activity, but the decoding axes for the same feature are roughly orthogonal between the two task phases, and the decodings are predominantly of features of the present during the trial but features of the preceding trial during the ITI. These subspace distinctions are carried forward into sleep, where population activity is preferentially reactivated in post-training sleep, but differently for activity from the trial and ITI subspaces. Our results suggest that the problem of interference when representing different states of the world is solved in mPfC by population activity occupying different subspaces for the world states, which can be independently decoded by downstream targets and independently addressed by upstream inputs.\\n\\nSignificance statementActivity in the medial prefrontal cortex plays a roles in representing the current and past states of the world. We show that during a maze task the activity of a single population in medial prefrontal cortex represents at least two different states of the world. These representations were sequential and sufficiently distinct that a downstream population could separately read out either state from that activity. Moreover, the activity representing different states is differently reactivated in sleep. Different world states can thus be represented in the same medial prefrontal cortex population, but in such a way that prevents potentially catastrophic interference between them.',\n",

This approach may be applicable to the brain, where speculations about quantum operations in consciousness and cognition have a long history.\\n\\nProton spins of bulk water, which most likely interfere with any brain function, can act as the known quantum systems. If an unknown mediator exists, then NMR methods based on multiple quantum coherence (MQC) can act as entanglement witness. However, there are doubts that todays NMR signals can contain quantum correlations in general, and specifically in the brain environment. Here, we used a witness protocol based on zero quantum coherence (ZQC) whereby we minimised the classical signals to circumvent the NMR detection limits for quantum correlation. For short repetitive periods, we found evoked signals in most parts of the brain, whereby the temporal appearance resembled heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs). We found that those signals had no correlates with any classical NMR contrast. Similar to HEPs, the evoked signal depended on conscious awareness. Consciousness-related or electrophysiological signals are unknown in NMR. Remarkably, these signals only appeared if the local properties of the magnetisation were reduced. Our findings suggest that we may have witnessed entanglement mediated by consciousness-related brain functions. Those brain functions must then operate non-classically, which would mean that consciousness is non-classical.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Humans and animals make predictions about the rewards they expect to receive in different situations. In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as value representations, and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive choice: the expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best option is selected. Secondly, they support learning: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. Whether these different functions are mediated by different neural representations remains an open question. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that computationally separates learning from choosing. We investigate the role of value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based cognition. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbations indicate that these representations do not directly drive choice.

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Midbrain dopamine neurons are essential for flexible control of adaptive behaviors. DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The organizational principles of glia remain largely unknown despite their vital role in nervous system function. Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors.

Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Sensory and motor processes undergo massive developmental changes over at least a decade in human development. Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges. Here, we assessed coordinative abilities of 120 children aged 4-12 for the two hands or a hand with another sensory signal in multiple, highly comparable sensorimotor tasks. This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains. Here, we charted the performance of 4-12- year-olds in six coordinative tasks that are all based on a common experimental paradigm but address three different sensorimotor-cognitive domains. This approach characterizes dependencies between multiple aspects of cognitive modulation in the interplay of sensory integration and motor control.',\n",

Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'ObjectiveThe mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is one of the master coordinators of cellular stress responses, regulating metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis. We recently reported that Staufen1 (STAU1), a stress granule (SG) protein, was overabundant in fibroblast cell lines from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal degeneration, Huntingtons, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons diseases as well as animal models, and patient tissues. STAU1 overabundance is associated with mTOR hyperactivation and links SG formation with autophagy. Our objective was to determine the mechanism of mTOR regulation by STAU1.\\n\\nMethodsWe determined STAU1 abundance with disease- and chemical-induced cellular stressors in patient cells and animal models. We also used RNA binding assays to contextualize STAU1 interaction with MTOR mRNA.\\n\\nResultsSTAU1 and mTOR were overabundant in BAC-C9orf72, ATXN2Q127, and Thy1-TDP-43 transgenic mouse models. Reducing STAU1 levels in these mice normalized mTOR levels and activity and autophagy-related marker proteins. We also saw increased STAU1 levels in HEK293 cells transfected to express C9orf72-relevant dipeptide repeats (DPRs). Conversely, DPR accumulations were not observed in cells treated by STAU1 RNAi. Overexpression of STAU1 in HEK293 cells increased mTOR levels through direct MTOR mRNA interaction, activating downstream targets and impairing autophagic flux. Targeting mTOR by rapamycin or RNAi normalized STAU1 abundance in a SCA2 cellular model.\\n\\nInterpretationSTAU1 interaction with mTOR drives its hyperactivation and inhibits autophagic flux in multiple models of neurodegeneration. Staufen, therefore, constitutes a novel target to modulate mTOR activity, autophagy, and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Medial prefrontal cortex (mPfC) activity represents information about the state of the world, including present behaviour, such as decisions, and the immediate past, such as short-term memory. Unknown is whether information about different states of the world are represented in the same mPfC neural population and, if so, how they are kept distinct. To address this, we analyse here mPfC population activity of rats learning rules in a Y-maze, with self-initiated choice trials to an arm-end followed by a self-paced return during the inter-trial interval (ITI). We find that trial and ITI population activity from the same population fall into different low-dimensional subspaces. These subspaces encode different states of the world: multiple features of the task can be decoded from both trial and ITI activity, but the decoding axes for the same feature are roughly orthogonal between the two task phases, and the decodings are predominantly of features of the present during the trial but features of the preceding trial during the ITI. These subspace distinctions are carried forward into sleep, where population activity is preferentially reactivated in post-training sleep, but differently for activity from the trial and ITI subspaces. Our results suggest that the problem of interference when representing different states of the world is solved in mPfC by population activity occupying different subspaces for the world states, which can be independently decoded by downstream targets and independently addressed by upstream inputs.\\n\\nSignificance statementActivity in the medial prefrontal cortex plays a roles in representing the current and past states of the world. We show that during a maze task the activity of a single population in medial prefrontal cortex represents at least two different states of the world. These representations were sequential and sufficiently distinct that a downstream population could separately read out either state from that activity. Moreover, the activity representing different states is differently reactivated in sleep. Different world states can thus be represented in the same medial prefrontal cortex population, but in such a way that prevents potentially catastrophic interference between them.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Humans and animals make predictions about the rewards they expect to receive in different situations. In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as value representations, and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive choice: the expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best option is selected. Secondly, they support learning: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. Whether these different functions are mediated by different neural representations remains an open question. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that computationally separates learning from choosing. We investigate the role of value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based cognition. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbations indicate that these representations do not directly drive choice. Instead, they signal expected reward information to a learning process elsewhere in the brain that updates choice mechanisms.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'AbstractEarly and economical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is pivotal for therapeutic efficacy, particularly for the settings where medical imaging resource is deficient. We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'What is the relationship between language and complex thought? In the context of deductive reasoning there are two main views. Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Midbrain dopamine neurons are essential for flexible control of adaptive behaviors. DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The organizational principles of glia remain largely unknown despite their vital role in nervous system function. Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety/stressor disorders frequently co-occur and this dual diagnosis represents a major health and economic problem worldwide. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Sensory and motor processes undergo massive developmental changes over at least a decade in human development. Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges. Here, we assessed coordinative abilities of 120 children aged 4-12 for the two hands or a hand with another sensory signal in multiple, highly comparable sensorimotor tasks. This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains. Here, we charted the performance of 4-12- year-olds in six coordinative tasks that are all based on a common experimental paradigm but address three different sensorimotor-cognitive domains. This approach characterizes dependencies between multiple aspects of cognitive modulation in the interplay of sensory integration and motor control.',\n",

Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

We recently reported that Staufen1 (STAU1), a stress granule (SG) protein, was overabundant in fibroblast cell lines from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal degeneration, Huntingtons, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons diseases as well as animal models, and patient tissues. STAU1 overabundance is associated with mTOR hyperactivation and links SG formation with autophagy. Our objective was to determine the mechanism of mTOR regulation by STAU1.\\n\\nMethodsWe determined STAU1 abundance with disease- and chemical-induced cellular stressors in patient cells and animal models. We also used RNA binding assays to contextualize STAU1 interaction with MTOR mRNA.\\n\\nResultsSTAU1 and mTOR were overabundant in BAC-C9orf72, ATXN2Q127, and Thy1-TDP-43 transgenic mouse models. Reducing STAU1 levels in these mice normalized mTOR levels and activity and autophagy-related marker proteins. We also saw increased STAU1 levels in HEK293 cells transfected to express C9orf72-relevant dipeptide repeats (DPRs). Conversely, DPR accumulations were not observed in cells treated by STAU1 RNAi. Overexpression of STAU1 in HEK293 cells increased mTOR levels through direct MTOR mRNA interaction, activating downstream targets and impairing autophagic flux. Targeting mTOR by rapamycin or RNAi normalized STAU1 abundance in a SCA2 cellular model.\\n\\nInterpretationSTAU1 interaction with mTOR drives its hyperactivation and inhibits autophagic flux in multiple models of neurodegeneration. Staufen, therefore, constitutes a novel target to modulate mTOR activity, autophagy, and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Medial prefrontal cortex (mPfC) activity represents information about the state of the world, including present behaviour, such as decisions, and the immediate past, such as short-term memory. Unknown is whether information about different states of the world are represented in the same mPfC neural population and, if so, how they are kept distinct. To address this, we analyse here mPfC population activity of rats learning rules in a Y-maze, with self-initiated choice trials to an arm-end followed by a self-paced return during the inter-trial interval (ITI). We find that trial and ITI population activity from the same population fall into different low-dimensional subspaces. These subspaces encode different states of the world: multiple features of the task can be decoded from both trial and ITI activity, but the decoding axes for the same feature are roughly orthogonal between the two task phases, and the decodings are predominantly of features of the present during the trial but features of the preceding trial during the ITI. These subspace distinctions are carried forward into sleep, where population activity is preferentially reactivated in post-training sleep, but differently for activity from the trial and ITI subspaces. Our results suggest that the problem of interference when representing different states of the world is solved in mPfC by population activity occupying different subspaces for the world states, which can be independently decoded by downstream targets and independently addressed by upstream inputs.\\n\\nSignificance statementActivity in the medial prefrontal cortex plays a roles in representing the current and past states of the world. We show that during a maze task the activity of a single population in medial prefrontal cortex represents at least two different states of the world. These representations were sequential and sufficiently distinct that a downstream population could separately read out either state from that activity. Moreover, the activity representing different states is differently reactivated in sleep. Different world states can thus be represented in the same medial prefrontal cortex population, but in such a way that prevents potentially catastrophic interference between them.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Humans and animals make predictions about the rewards they expect to receive in different situations. In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as value representations, and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive choice: the expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best option is selected. Secondly, they support learning: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. Whether these different functions are mediated by different neural representations remains an open question. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that computationally separates learning from choosing. We investigate the role of value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based cognition. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbations indicate that these representations do not directly drive choice. Instead, they signal expected reward information to a learning process elsewhere in the brain that updates choice mechanisms.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'AbstractEarly and economical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is pivotal for therapeutic efficacy, particularly for the settings where medical imaging resource is deficient. We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'What is the relationship between language and complex thought? In the context of deductive reasoning there are two main views. Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Midbrain dopamine neurons are essential for flexible control of adaptive behaviors. DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety/stressor disorders frequently co-occur and this dual diagnosis represents a major health and economic problem worldwide. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges. Here, we assessed coordinative abilities of 120 children aged 4-12 for the two hands or a hand with another sensory signal in multiple, highly comparable sensorimotor tasks. This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains. Here, we charted the performance of 4-12- year-olds in six coordinative tasks that are all based on a common experimental paradigm but address three different sensorimotor-cognitive domains. This approach characterizes dependencies between multiple aspects of cognitive modulation in the interplay of sensory integration and motor control.',\n",

Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

We recently reported that Staufen1 (STAU1), a stress granule (SG) protein, was overabundant in fibroblast cell lines from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal degeneration, Huntingtons, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons diseases as well as animal models, and patient tissues. STAU1 overabundance is associated with mTOR hyperactivation and links SG formation with autophagy. Our objective was to determine the mechanism of mTOR regulation by STAU1.\\n\\nMethodsWe determined STAU1 abundance with disease- and chemical-induced cellular stressors in patient cells and animal models. We also used RNA binding assays to contextualize STAU1 interaction with MTOR mRNA.\\n\\nResultsSTAU1 and mTOR were overabundant in BAC-C9orf72, ATXN2Q127, and Thy1-TDP-43 transgenic mouse models. Reducing STAU1 levels in these mice normalized mTOR levels and activity and autophagy-related marker proteins. We also saw increased STAU1 levels in HEK293 cells transfected to express C9orf72-relevant dipeptide repeats (DPRs). Conversely, DPR accumulations were not observed in cells treated by STAU1 RNAi. Overexpression of STAU1 in HEK293 cells increased mTOR levels through direct MTOR mRNA interaction, activating downstream targets and impairing autophagic flux. Targeting mTOR by rapamycin or RNAi normalized STAU1 abundance in a SCA2 cellular model.\\n\\nInterpretationSTAU1 interaction with mTOR drives its hyperactivation and inhibits autophagic flux in multiple models of neurodegeneration. Staufen, therefore, constitutes a novel target to modulate mTOR activity, autophagy, and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Medial prefrontal cortex (mPfC) activity represents information about the state of the world, including present behaviour, such as decisions, and the immediate past, such as short-term memory. Unknown is whether information about different states of the world are represented in the same mPfC neural population and, if so, how they are kept distinct. To address this, we analyse here mPfC population activity of rats learning rules in a Y-maze, with self-initiated choice trials to an arm-end followed by a self-paced return during the inter-trial interval (ITI). We find that trial and ITI population activity from the same population fall into different low-dimensional subspaces. These subspaces encode different states of the world: multiple features of the task can be decoded from both trial and ITI activity, but the decoding axes for the same feature are roughly orthogonal between the two task phases, and the decodings are predominantly of features of the present during the trial but features of the preceding trial during the ITI. These subspace distinctions are carried forward into sleep, where population activity is preferentially reactivated in post-training sleep, but differently for activity from the trial and ITI subspaces. Our results suggest that the problem of interference when representing different states of the world is solved in mPfC by population activity occupying different subspaces for the world states, which can be independently decoded by downstream targets and independently addressed by upstream inputs.\\n\\nSignificance statementActivity in the medial prefrontal cortex plays a roles in representing the current and past states of the world. We show that during a maze task the activity of a single population in medial prefrontal cortex represents at least two different states of the world. These representations were sequential and sufficiently distinct that a downstream population could separately read out either state from that activity. Moreover, the activity representing different states is differently reactivated in sleep. Different world states can thus be represented in the same medial prefrontal cortex population, but in such a way that prevents potentially catastrophic interference between them.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Humans and animals make predictions about the rewards they expect to receive in different situations. In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as value representations, and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive choice: the expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best option is selected. Secondly, they support learning: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. Whether these different functions are mediated by different neural representations remains an open question. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that computationally separates learning from choosing. We investigate the role of value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based cognition. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbations indicate that these representations do not directly drive choice. Instead, they signal expected reward information to a learning process elsewhere in the brain that updates choice mechanisms.',\n",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Midbrain dopamine neurons are essential for flexible control of adaptive behaviors. DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

A new precision center-out task was performed by rhesus macaques to test the hypothesis that cyclic, condition-independent neural activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) occurs not only during initial reaching movements but also during subsequent corrective movements. Corrective movements were observed to be discrete with time courses and bell-shaped speed profiles similar to the initial movements. Condition-independent cyclic neural trajectories were similar and repeated for initial and each additional corrective submovement. The phase of the cyclic condition-independent neural activity predicted the time of peak movement speed more accurately than regression of instantaneous firing rate, even when the subject made multiple corrective movements. Rather than being controlled as continuations of the initial reach, a discrete cycle of motor cortex activity encodes each corrective submovement.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDuring a precision center-out task, initial and subsequent corrective movements occur as discrete submovements with bell-shaped speed profiles. A cycle of condition-independent activity in primary motor cortex neuron populations corresponds to each submovement, such that the phase of this cyclic activity predicts the time of peak speeds--both initial and corrective. These submovements accompanied by cyclic neural activity offer important clues into how we successfully execute precise, corrective reaching movements and may have implications for optimizing control of brain-computer interfaces.',\n",

A new precision center-out task was performed by rhesus macaques to test the hypothesis that cyclic, condition-independent neural activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) occurs not only during initial reaching movements but also during subsequent corrective movements. Corrective movements were observed to be discrete with time courses and bell-shaped speed profiles similar to the initial movements. Condition-independent cyclic neural trajectories were similar and repeated for initial and each additional corrective submovement. The phase of the cyclic condition-independent neural activity predicted the time of peak movement speed more accurately than regression of instantaneous firing rate, even when the subject made multiple corrective movements. Rather than being controlled as continuations of the initial reach, a discrete cycle of motor cortex activity encodes each corrective submovement.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDuring a precision center-out task, initial and subsequent corrective movements occur as discrete submovements with bell-shaped speed profiles. A cycle of condition-independent activity in primary motor cortex neuron populations corresponds to each submovement, such that the phase of this cyclic activity predicts the time of peak speeds--both initial and corrective. These submovements accompanied by cyclic neural activity offer important clues into how we successfully execute precise, corrective reaching movements and may have implications for optimizing control of brain-computer interfaces.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety/stressor disorders frequently co-occur and this dual diagnosis represents a major health and economic problem worldwide. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges. Here, we assessed coordinative abilities of 120 children aged 4-12 for the two hands or a hand with another sensory signal in multiple, highly comparable sensorimotor tasks. This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains. Here, we charted the performance of 4-12- year-olds in six coordinative tasks that are all based on a common experimental paradigm but address three different sensorimotor-cognitive domains.

Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

We recently reported that Staufen1 (STAU1), a stress granule (SG) protein, was overabundant in fibroblast cell lines from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal degeneration, Huntingtons, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons diseases as well as animal models, and patient tissues. STAU1 overabundance is associated with mTOR hyperactivation and links SG formation with autophagy. Our objective was to determine the mechanism of mTOR regulation by STAU1.\\n\\nMethodsWe determined STAU1 abundance with disease- and chemical-induced cellular stressors in patient cells and animal models. We also used RNA binding assays to contextualize STAU1 interaction with MTOR mRNA.\\n\\nResultsSTAU1 and mTOR were overabundant in BAC-C9orf72, ATXN2Q127, and Thy1-TDP-43 transgenic mouse models. Reducing STAU1 levels in these mice normalized mTOR levels and activity and autophagy-related marker proteins. We also saw increased STAU1 levels in HEK293 cells transfected to express C9orf72-relevant dipeptide repeats (DPRs). Conversely, DPR accumulations were not observed in cells treated by STAU1 RNAi. Overexpression of STAU1 in HEK293 cells increased mTOR levels through direct MTOR mRNA interaction, activating downstream targets and impairing autophagic flux. Targeting mTOR by rapamycin or RNAi normalized STAU1 abundance in a SCA2 cellular model.\\n\\nInterpretationSTAU1 interaction with mTOR drives its hyperactivation and inhibits autophagic flux in multiple models of neurodegeneration.

       " 'abstract': 'Medial prefrontal cortex (mPfC) activity represents information about the state of the world, including present behaviour, such as decisions, and the immediate past, such as short-term memory. Unknown is whether information about different states of the world are represented in the same mPfC neural population and, if so, how they are kept distinct. To address this, we analyse here mPfC population activity of rats learning rules in a Y-maze, with self-initiated choice trials to an arm-end followed by a self-paced return during the inter-trial interval (ITI). We find that trial and ITI population activity from the same population fall into different low-dimensional subspaces. These subspaces encode different states of the world: multiple features of the task can be decoded from both trial and ITI activity, but the decoding axes for the same feature are roughly orthogonal between the two task phases, and the decodings are predominantly of features of the present during the trial but features of the preceding trial during the ITI. These subspace distinctions are carried forward into sleep, where population activity is preferentially reactivated in post-training sleep, but differently for activity from the trial and ITI subspaces. Our results suggest that the problem of interference when representing different states of the world is solved in mPfC by population activity occupying different subspaces for the world states, which can be independently decoded by downstream targets and independently addressed by upstream inputs.\\n\\nSignificance statementActivity in the medial prefrontal cortex plays a roles in representing the current and past states of the world. We show that during a maze task the activity of a single population in medial prefrontal cortex represents at least two different states of the world. These representations were sequential and sufficiently distinct that a downstream population could separately read out either state from that activity. Moreover, the activity representing different states is differently reactivated in sleep. Different world states can thus be represented in the same medial prefrontal cortex population, but in such a way that prevents potentially catastrophic interference between them.',\n",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Midbrain dopamine neurons are essential for flexible control of adaptive behaviors. DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Reaching movements are known to have large condition-independent neural activity and cyclic neural dynamics. A new precision center-out task was performed by rhesus macaques to test the hypothesis that cyclic, condition-independent neural activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) occurs not only during initial reaching movements but also during subsequent corrective movements. Corrective movements were observed to be discrete with time courses and bell-shaped speed profiles similar to the initial movements. Condition-independent cyclic neural trajectories were similar and repeated for initial and each additional corrective submovement. The phase of the cyclic condition-independent neural activity predicted the time of peak movement speed more accurately than regression of instantaneous firing rate, even when the subject made multiple corrective movements. Rather than being controlled as continuations of the initial reach, a discrete cycle of motor cortex activity encodes each corrective submovement.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDuring a precision center-out task, initial and subsequent corrective movements occur as discrete submovements with bell-shaped speed profiles. A cycle of condition-independent activity in primary motor cortex neuron populations corresponds to each submovement, such that the phase of this cyclic activity predicts the time of peak speeds--both initial and corrective. These submovements accompanied by cyclic neural activity offer important clues into how we successfully execute precise, corrective reaching movements and may have implications for optimizing control of brain-computer interfaces.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Reaching movements are known to have large condition-independent neural activity and cyclic neural dynamics. A new precision center-out task was performed by rhesus macaques to test the hypothesis that cyclic, condition-independent neural activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) occurs not only during initial reaching movements but also during subsequent corrective movements. Corrective movements were observed to be discrete with time courses and bell-shaped speed profiles similar to the initial movements. Condition-independent cyclic neural trajectories were similar and repeated for initial and each additional corrective submovement. The phase of the cyclic condition-independent neural activity predicted the time of peak movement speed more accurately than regression of instantaneous firing rate, even when the subject made multiple corrective movements. Rather than being controlled as continuations of the initial reach, a discrete cycle of motor cortex activity encodes each corrective submovement.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDuring a precision center-out task, initial and subsequent corrective movements occur as discrete submovements with bell-shaped speed profiles. A cycle of condition-independent activity in primary motor cortex neuron populations corresponds to each submovement, such that the phase of this cyclic activity predicts the time of peak speeds--both initial and corrective. These submovements accompanied by cyclic neural activity offer important clues into how we successfully execute precise, corrective reaching movements and may have implications for optimizing control of brain-computer interfaces.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety/stressor disorders frequently co-occur and this dual diagnosis represents a major health and economic problem worldwide. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Sensory and motor processes undergo massive developmental changes over at least a decade in human development. Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges. Here, we assessed coordinative abilities of 120 children aged 4-12 for the two hands or a hand with another sensory signal in multiple, highly comparable sensorimotor tasks. This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains. Here, we charted the performance of 4-12- year-olds in six coordinative tasks that are all based on a common experimental paradigm but address three different sensorimotor-cognitive domains.

Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

We recently reported that Staufen1 (STAU1), a stress granule (SG) protein, was overabundant in fibroblast cell lines from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal degeneration, Huntingtons, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons diseases as well as animal models, and patient tissues. STAU1 overabundance is associated with mTOR hyperactivation and links SG formation with autophagy. Our objective was to determine the mechanism of mTOR regulation by STAU1.\\n\\nMethodsWe determined STAU1 abundance with disease- and chemical-induced cellular stressors in patient cells and animal models. We also used RNA binding assays to contextualize STAU1 interaction with MTOR mRNA.\\n\\nResultsSTAU1 and mTOR were overabundant in BAC-C9orf72, ATXN2Q127, and Thy1-TDP-43 transgenic mouse models. Reducing STAU1 levels in these mice normalized mTOR levels and activity and autophagy-related marker proteins. We also saw increased STAU1 levels in HEK293 cells transfected to express C9orf72-relevant dipeptide repeats (DPRs). Conversely, DPR accumulations were not observed in cells treated by STAU1 RNAi. Overexpression of STAU1 in HEK293 cells increased mTOR levels through direct MTOR mRNA interaction, activating downstream targets and impairing autophagic flux. Targeting mTOR by rapamycin or RNAi normalized STAU1 abundance in a SCA2 cellular model.\\n\\nInterpretationSTAU1 interaction with mTOR drives its hyperactivation and inhibits autophagic flux in multiple models of neurodegeneration. Staufen, therefore, constitutes a novel target to modulate mTOR activity, autophagy, and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Medial prefrontal cortex (mPfC) activity represents information about the state of the world, including present behaviour, such as decisions, and the immediate past, such as short-term memory. Unknown is whether information about different states of the world are represented in the same mPfC neural population and, if so, how they are kept distinct. To address this, we analyse here mPfC population activity of rats learning rules in a Y-maze, with self-initiated choice trials to an arm-end followed by a self-paced return during the inter-trial interval (ITI). We find that trial and ITI population activity from the same population fall into different low-dimensional subspaces. These subspaces encode different states of the world: multiple features of the task can be decoded from both trial and ITI activity, but the decoding axes for the same feature are roughly orthogonal between the two task phases, and the decodings are predominantly of features of the present during the trial but features of the preceding trial during the ITI. These subspace distinctions are carried forward into sleep, where population activity is preferentially reactivated in post-training sleep, but differently for activity from the trial and ITI subspaces. Our results suggest that the problem of interference when representing different states of the world is solved in mPfC by population activity occupying different subspaces for the world states, which can be independently decoded by downstream targets and independently addressed by upstream inputs.\\n\\nSignificance statementActivity in the medial prefrontal cortex plays a roles in representing the current and past states of the world. We show that during a maze task the activity of a single population in medial prefrontal cortex represents at least two different states of the world. These representations were sequential and sufficiently distinct that a downstream population could separately read out either state from that activity. Moreover, the activity representing different states is differently reactivated in sleep. Different world states can thus be represented in the same medial prefrontal cortex population, but in such a way that prevents potentially catastrophic interference between them.',\n",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'What is the relationship between language and complex thought? In the context of deductive reasoning there are two main views. Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Midbrain dopamine neurons are essential for flexible control of adaptive behaviors. DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

A new precision center-out task was performed by rhesus macaques to test the hypothesis that cyclic, condition-independent neural activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) occurs not only during initial reaching movements but also during subsequent corrective movements. Corrective movements were observed to be discrete with time courses and bell-shaped speed profiles similar to the initial movements. Condition-independent cyclic neural trajectories were similar and repeated for initial and each additional corrective submovement. The phase of the cyclic condition-independent neural activity predicted the time of peak movement speed more accurately than regression of instantaneous firing rate, even when the subject made multiple corrective movements. Rather than being controlled as continuations of the initial reach, a discrete cycle of motor cortex activity encodes each corrective submovement.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDuring a precision center-out task, initial and subsequent corrective movements occur as discrete submovements with bell-shaped speed profiles. A cycle of condition-independent activity in primary motor cortex neuron populations corresponds to each submovement, such that the phase of this cyclic activity predicts the time of peak speeds--both initial and corrective. These submovements accompanied by cyclic neural activity offer important clues into how we successfully execute precise, corrective reaching movements and may have implications for optimizing control of brain-computer interfaces.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Reaching movements are known to have large condition-independent neural activity and cyclic neural dynamics. A new precision center-out task was performed by rhesus macaques to test the hypothesis that cyclic, condition-independent neural activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) occurs not only during initial reaching movements but also during subsequent corrective movements. Corrective movements were observed to be discrete with time courses and bell-shaped speed profiles similar to the initial movements. Condition-independent cyclic neural trajectories were similar and repeated for initial and each additional corrective submovement. The phase of the cyclic condition-independent neural activity predicted the time of peak movement speed more accurately than regression of instantaneous firing rate, even when the subject made multiple corrective movements. Rather than being controlled as continuations of the initial reach, a discrete cycle of motor cortex activity encodes each corrective submovement.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDuring a precision center-out task, initial and subsequent corrective movements occur as discrete submovements with bell-shaped speed profiles. A cycle of condition-independent activity in primary motor cortex neuron populations corresponds to each submovement, such that the phase of this cyclic activity predicts the time of peak speeds--both initial and corrective. These submovements accompanied by cyclic neural activity offer important clues into how we successfully execute precise, corrective reaching movements and may have implications for optimizing control of brain-computer interfaces.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety/stressor disorders frequently co-occur and this dual diagnosis represents a major health and economic problem worldwide. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges. Here, we assessed coordinative abilities of 120 children aged 4-12 for the two hands or a hand with another sensory signal in multiple, highly comparable sensorimotor tasks. This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains.

Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

We also used RNA binding assays to contextualize STAU1 interaction with MTOR mRNA.\\n\\nResultsSTAU1 and mTOR were overabundant in BAC-C9orf72, ATXN2Q127, and Thy1-TDP-43 transgenic mouse models. Reducing STAU1 levels in these mice normalized mTOR levels and activity and autophagy-related marker proteins. We also saw increased STAU1 levels in HEK293 cells transfected to express C9orf72-relevant dipeptide repeats (DPRs). Conversely, DPR accumulations were not observed in cells treated by STAU1 RNAi. Overexpression of STAU1 in HEK293 cells increased mTOR levels through direct MTOR mRNA interaction, activating downstream targets and impairing autophagic flux. Targeting mTOR by rapamycin or RNAi normalized STAU1 abundance in a SCA2 cellular model.\\n\\nInterpretationSTAU1 interaction with mTOR drives its hyperactivation and inhibits autophagic flux in multiple models of neurodegeneration. Staufen, therefore, constitutes a novel target to modulate mTOR activity, autophagy, and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Medial prefrontal cortex (mPfC) activity represents information about the state of the world, including present behaviour, such as decisions, and the immediate past, such as short-term memory. Unknown is whether information about different states of the world are represented in the same mPfC neural population and, if so, how they are kept distinct. To address this, we analyse here mPfC population activity of rats learning rules in a Y-maze, with self-initiated choice trials to an arm-end followed by a self-paced return during the inter-trial interval (ITI). We find that trial and ITI population activity from the same population fall into different low-dimensional subspaces. These subspaces encode different states of the world: multiple features of the task can be decoded from both trial and ITI activity, but the decoding axes for the same feature are roughly orthogonal between the two task phases, and the decodings are predominantly of features of the present during the trial but features of the preceding trial during the ITI. These subspace distinctions are carried forward into sleep, where population activity is preferentially reactivated in post-training sleep, but differently for activity from the trial and ITI subspaces. Our results suggest that the problem of interference when representing different states of the world is solved in mPfC by population activity occupying different subspaces for the world states, which can be independently decoded by downstream targets and independently addressed by upstream inputs.\\n\\nSignificance statementActivity in the medial prefrontal cortex plays a roles in representing the current and past states of the world. We show that during a maze task the activity of a single population in medial prefrontal cortex represents at least two different states of the world. These representations were sequential and sufficiently distinct that a downstream population could separately read out either state from that activity. Moreover, the activity representing different states is differently reactivated in sleep. Different world states can thus be represented in the same medial prefrontal cortex population, but in such a way that prevents potentially catastrophic interference between them.',\n",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'What is the relationship between language and complex thought? In the context of deductive reasoning there are two main views. Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Midbrain dopamine neurons are essential for flexible control of adaptive behaviors. DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

A new precision center-out task was performed by rhesus macaques to test the hypothesis that cyclic, condition-independent neural activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) occurs not only during initial reaching movements but also during subsequent corrective movements. Corrective movements were observed to be discrete with time courses and bell-shaped speed profiles similar to the initial movements. Condition-independent cyclic neural trajectories were similar and repeated for initial and each additional corrective submovement. The phase of the cyclic condition-independent neural activity predicted the time of peak movement speed more accurately than regression of instantaneous firing rate, even when the subject made multiple corrective movements. Rather than being controlled as continuations of the initial reach, a discrete cycle of motor cortex activity encodes each corrective submovement.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDuring a precision center-out task, initial and subsequent corrective movements occur as discrete submovements with bell-shaped speed profiles.

       " 'abstract': 'Reaching movements are known to have large condition-independent neural activity and cyclic neural dynamics. A new precision center-out task was performed by rhesus macaques to test the hypothesis that cyclic, condition-independent neural activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) occurs not only during initial reaching movements but also during subsequent corrective movements. Corrective movements were observed to be discrete with time courses and bell-shaped speed profiles similar to the initial movements. Condition-independent cyclic neural trajectories were similar and repeated for initial and each additional corrective submovement. The phase of the cyclic condition-independent neural activity predicted the time of peak movement speed more accurately than regression of instantaneous firing rate, even when the subject made multiple corrective movements. Rather than being controlled as continuations of the initial reach, a discrete cycle of motor cortex activity encodes each corrective submovement.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDuring a precision center-out task, initial and subsequent corrective movements occur as discrete submovements with bell-shaped speed profiles.

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety/stressor disorders frequently co-occur and this dual diagnosis represents a major health and economic problem worldwide. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges. Here, we assessed coordinative abilities of 120 children aged 4-12 for the two hands or a hand with another sensory signal in multiple, highly comparable sensorimotor tasks. This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains.

Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'ObjectiveThe mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is one of the master coordinators of cellular stress responses, regulating metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis. We recently reported that Staufen1 (STAU1), a stress granule (SG) protein, was overabundant in fibroblast cell lines from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal degeneration, Huntingtons, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons diseases as well as animal models, and patient tissues. STAU1 overabundance is associated with mTOR hyperactivation and links SG formation with autophagy. Our objective was to determine the mechanism of mTOR regulation by STAU1.\\n\\nMethodsWe determined STAU1 abundance with disease- and chemical-induced cellular stressors in patient cells and animal models. We also used RNA binding assays to contextualize STAU1 interaction with MTOR mRNA.\\n\\nResultsSTAU1 and mTOR were overabundant in BAC-C9orf72, ATXN2Q127, and Thy1-TDP-43 transgenic mouse models. Reducing STAU1 levels in these mice normalized mTOR levels and activity and autophagy-related marker proteins. We also saw increased STAU1 levels in HEK293 cells transfected to express C9orf72-relevant dipeptide repeats (DPRs). Conversely, DPR accumulations were not observed in cells treated by STAU1 RNAi. Overexpression of STAU1 in HEK293 cells increased mTOR levels through direct MTOR mRNA interaction, activating downstream targets and impairing autophagic flux. Targeting mTOR by rapamycin or RNAi normalized STAU1 abundance in a SCA2 cellular model.\\n\\nInterpretationSTAU1 interaction with mTOR drives its hyperactivation and inhibits autophagic flux in multiple models of neurodegeneration. Staufen, therefore, constitutes a novel target to modulate mTOR activity, autophagy, and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Medial prefrontal cortex (mPfC) activity represents information about the state of the world, including present behaviour, such as decisions, and the immediate past, such as short-term memory. Unknown is whether information about different states of the world are represented in the same mPfC neural population and, if so, how they are kept distinct. To address this, we analyse here mPfC population activity of rats learning rules in a Y-maze, with self-initiated choice trials to an arm-end followed by a self-paced return during the inter-trial interval (ITI). We find that trial and ITI population activity from the same population fall into different low-dimensional subspaces. These subspaces encode different states of the world: multiple features of the task can be decoded from both trial and ITI activity, but the decoding axes for the same feature are roughly orthogonal between the two task phases, and the decodings are predominantly of features of the present during the trial but features of the preceding trial during the ITI. These subspace distinctions are carried forward into sleep, where population activity is preferentially reactivated in post-training sleep, but differently for activity from the trial and ITI subspaces. Our results suggest that the problem of interference when representing different states of the world is solved in mPfC by population activity occupying different subspaces for the world states, which can be independently decoded by downstream targets and independently addressed by upstream inputs.\\n\\nSignificance statementActivity in the medial prefrontal cortex plays a roles in representing the current and past states of the world. We show that during a maze task the activity of a single population in medial prefrontal cortex represents at least two different states of the world. These representations were sequential and sufficiently distinct that a downstream population could separately read out either state from that activity. Moreover, the activity representing different states is differently reactivated in sleep. Different world states can thus be represented in the same medial prefrontal cortex population, but in such a way that prevents potentially catastrophic interference between them.',\n",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'What is the relationship between language and complex thought? In the context of deductive reasoning there are two main views. Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Midbrain dopamine neurons are essential for flexible control of adaptive behaviors. DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety/stressor disorders frequently co-occur and this dual diagnosis represents a major health and economic problem worldwide. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Sensory and motor processes undergo massive developmental changes over at least a decade in human development. Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges. Here, we assessed coordinative abilities of 120 children aged 4-12 for the two hands or a hand with another sensory signal in multiple, highly comparable sensorimotor tasks. This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains. Here, we charted the performance of 4-12- year-olds in six coordinative tasks that are all based on a common experimental paradigm but address three different sensorimotor-cognitive domains. This approach characterizes dependencies between multiple aspects of cognitive modulation in the interplay of sensory integration and motor control.',\n",

Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'ObjectiveThe mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is one of the master coordinators of cellular stress responses, regulating metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis. We recently reported that Staufen1 (STAU1), a stress granule (SG) protein, was overabundant in fibroblast cell lines from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal degeneration, Huntingtons, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons diseases as well as animal models, and patient tissues. STAU1 overabundance is associated with mTOR hyperactivation and links SG formation with autophagy. Our objective was to determine the mechanism of mTOR regulation by STAU1.\\n\\nMethodsWe determined STAU1 abundance with disease- and chemical-induced cellular stressors in patient cells and animal models. We also used RNA binding assays to contextualize STAU1 interaction with MTOR mRNA.\\n\\nResultsSTAU1 and mTOR were overabundant in BAC-C9orf72, ATXN2Q127, and Thy1-TDP-43 transgenic mouse models. Reducing STAU1 levels in these mice normalized mTOR levels and activity and autophagy-related marker proteins. We also saw increased STAU1 levels in HEK293 cells transfected to express C9orf72-relevant dipeptide repeats (DPRs). Conversely, DPR accumulations were not observed in cells treated by STAU1 RNAi. Overexpression of STAU1 in HEK293 cells increased mTOR levels through direct MTOR mRNA interaction, activating downstream targets and impairing autophagic flux. Targeting mTOR by rapamycin or RNAi normalized STAU1 abundance in a SCA2 cellular model.\\n\\nInterpretationSTAU1 interaction with mTOR drives its hyperactivation and inhibits autophagic flux in multiple models of neurodegeneration. Staufen, therefore, constitutes a novel target to modulate mTOR activity, autophagy, and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Medial prefrontal cortex (mPfC) activity represents information about the state of the world, including present behaviour, such as decisions, and the immediate past, such as short-term memory. Unknown is whether information about different states of the world are represented in the same mPfC neural population and, if so, how they are kept distinct. To address this, we analyse here mPfC population activity of rats learning rules in a Y-maze, with self-initiated choice trials to an arm-end followed by a self-paced return during the inter-trial interval (ITI). We find that trial and ITI population activity from the same population fall into different low-dimensional subspaces. These subspaces encode different states of the world: multiple features of the task can be decoded from both trial and ITI activity, but the decoding axes for the same feature are roughly orthogonal between the two task phases, and the decodings are predominantly of features of the present during the trial but features of the preceding trial during the ITI. These subspace distinctions are carried forward into sleep, where population activity is preferentially reactivated in post-training sleep, but differently for activity from the trial and ITI subspaces. Our results suggest that the problem of interference when representing different states of the world is solved in mPfC by population activity occupying different subspaces for the world states, which can be independently decoded by downstream targets and independently addressed by upstream inputs.\\n\\nSignificance statementActivity in the medial prefrontal cortex plays a roles in representing the current and past states of the world. We show that during a maze task the activity of a single population in medial prefrontal cortex represents at least two different states of the world. These representations were sequential and sufficiently distinct that a downstream population could separately read out either state from that activity. Moreover, the activity representing different states is differently reactivated in sleep. Different world states can thus be represented in the same medial prefrontal cortex population, but in such a way that prevents potentially catastrophic interference between them.',\n",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'What is the relationship between language and complex thought? In the context of deductive reasoning there are two main views. Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Midbrain dopamine neurons are essential for flexible control of adaptive behaviors. DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety/stressor disorders frequently co-occur and this dual diagnosis represents a major health and economic problem worldwide. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Sensory and motor processes undergo massive developmental changes over at least a decade in human development. Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges. Here, we assessed coordinative abilities of 120 children aged 4-12 for the two hands or a hand with another sensory signal in multiple, highly comparable sensorimotor tasks. This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains. Here, we charted the performance of 4-12- year-olds in six coordinative tasks that are all based on a common experimental paradigm but address three different sensorimotor-cognitive domains. This approach characterizes dependencies between multiple aspects of cognitive modulation in the interplay of sensory integration and motor control.',\n",

Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'ObjectiveThe mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is one of the master coordinators of cellular stress responses, regulating metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis. We recently reported that Staufen1 (STAU1), a stress granule (SG) protein, was overabundant in fibroblast cell lines from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal degeneration, Huntingtons, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons diseases as well as animal models, and patient tissues. STAU1 overabundance is associated with mTOR hyperactivation and links SG formation with autophagy. Our objective was to determine the mechanism of mTOR regulation by STAU1.\\n\\nMethodsWe determined STAU1 abundance with disease- and chemical-induced cellular stressors in patient cells and animal models. We also used RNA binding assays to contextualize STAU1 interaction with MTOR mRNA.\\n\\nResultsSTAU1 and mTOR were overabundant in BAC-C9orf72, ATXN2Q127, and Thy1-TDP-43 transgenic mouse models. Reducing STAU1 levels in these mice normalized mTOR levels and activity and autophagy-related marker proteins. We also saw increased STAU1 levels in HEK293 cells transfected to express C9orf72-relevant dipeptide repeats (DPRs). Conversely, DPR accumulations were not observed in cells treated by STAU1 RNAi. Overexpression of STAU1 in HEK293 cells increased mTOR levels through direct MTOR mRNA interaction, activating downstream targets and impairing autophagic flux. Targeting mTOR by rapamycin or RNAi normalized STAU1 abundance in a SCA2 cellular model.\\n\\nInterpretationSTAU1 interaction with mTOR drives its hyperactivation and inhibits autophagic flux in multiple models of neurodegeneration. Staufen, therefore, constitutes a novel target to modulate mTOR activity, autophagy, and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Medial prefrontal cortex (mPfC) activity represents information about the state of the world, including present behaviour, such as decisions, and the immediate past, such as short-term memory. Unknown is whether information about different states of the world are represented in the same mPfC neural population and, if so, how they are kept distinct. To address this, we analyse here mPfC population activity of rats learning rules in a Y-maze, with self-initiated choice trials to an arm-end followed by a self-paced return during the inter-trial interval (ITI). We find that trial and ITI population activity from the same population fall into different low-dimensional subspaces. These subspaces encode different states of the world: multiple features of the task can be decoded from both trial and ITI activity, but the decoding axes for the same feature are roughly orthogonal between the two task phases, and the decodings are predominantly of features of the present during the trial but features of the preceding trial during the ITI. These subspace distinctions are carried forward into sleep, where population activity is preferentially reactivated in post-training sleep, but differently for activity from the trial and ITI subspaces. Our results suggest that the problem of interference when representing different states of the world is solved in mPfC by population activity occupying different subspaces for the world states, which can be independently decoded by downstream targets and independently addressed by upstream inputs.\\n\\nSignificance statementActivity in the medial prefrontal cortex plays a roles in representing the current and past states of the world. We show that during a maze task the activity of a single population in medial prefrontal cortex represents at least two different states of the world. These representations were sequential and sufficiently distinct that a downstream population could separately read out either state from that activity. Moreover, the activity representing different states is differently reactivated in sleep. Different world states can thus be represented in the same medial prefrontal cortex population, but in such a way that prevents potentially catastrophic interference between them.',\n",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'What is the relationship between language and complex thought? In the context of deductive reasoning there are two main views. Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Midbrain dopamine neurons are essential for flexible control of adaptive behaviors. DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety/stressor disorders frequently co-occur and this dual diagnosis represents a major health and economic problem worldwide. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Sensory and motor processes undergo massive developmental changes over at least a decade in human development. Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges. Here, we assessed coordinative abilities of 120 children aged 4-12 for the two hands or a hand with another sensory signal in multiple, highly comparable sensorimotor tasks. This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains. Here, we charted the performance of 4-12- year-olds in six coordinative tasks that are all based on a common experimental paradigm but address three different sensorimotor-cognitive domains. This approach characterizes dependencies between multiple aspects of cognitive modulation in the interplay of sensory integration and motor control.',\n",

Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'ObjectiveThe mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is one of the master coordinators of cellular stress responses, regulating metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis. We recently reported that Staufen1 (STAU1), a stress granule (SG) protein, was overabundant in fibroblast cell lines from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal degeneration, Huntingtons, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons diseases as well as animal models, and patient tissues. STAU1 overabundance is associated with mTOR hyperactivation and links SG formation with autophagy. Our objective was to determine the mechanism of mTOR regulation by STAU1.\\n\\nMethodsWe determined STAU1 abundance with disease- and chemical-induced cellular stressors in patient cells and animal models. We also used RNA binding assays to contextualize STAU1 interaction with MTOR mRNA.\\n\\nResultsSTAU1 and mTOR were overabundant in BAC-C9orf72, ATXN2Q127, and Thy1-TDP-43 transgenic mouse models. Reducing STAU1 levels in these mice normalized mTOR levels and activity and autophagy-related marker proteins. We also saw increased STAU1 levels in HEK293 cells transfected to express C9orf72-relevant dipeptide repeats (DPRs). Conversely, DPR accumulations were not observed in cells treated by STAU1 RNAi. Overexpression of STAU1 in HEK293 cells increased mTOR levels through direct MTOR mRNA interaction, activating downstream targets and impairing autophagic flux. Targeting mTOR by rapamycin or RNAi normalized STAU1 abundance in a SCA2 cellular model.\\n\\nInterpretationSTAU1 interaction with mTOR drives its hyperactivation and inhibits autophagic flux in multiple models of neurodegeneration. Staufen, therefore, constitutes a novel target to modulate mTOR activity, autophagy, and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Medial prefrontal cortex (mPfC) activity represents information about the state of the world, including present behaviour, such as decisions, and the immediate past, such as short-term memory. Unknown is whether information about different states of the world are represented in the same mPfC neural population and, if so, how they are kept distinct. To address this, we analyse here mPfC population activity of rats learning rules in a Y-maze, with self-initiated choice trials to an arm-end followed by a self-paced return during the inter-trial interval (ITI). We find that trial and ITI population activity from the same population fall into different low-dimensional subspaces. These subspaces encode different states of the world: multiple features of the task can be decoded from both trial and ITI activity, but the decoding axes for the same feature are roughly orthogonal between the two task phases, and the decodings are predominantly of features of the present during the trial but features of the preceding trial during the ITI. These subspace distinctions are carried forward into sleep, where population activity is preferentially reactivated in post-training sleep, but differently for activity from the trial and ITI subspaces. Our results suggest that the problem of interference when representing different states of the world is solved in mPfC by population activity occupying different subspaces for the world states, which can be independently decoded by downstream targets and independently addressed by upstream inputs.\\n\\nSignificance statementActivity in the medial prefrontal cortex plays a roles in representing the current and past states of the world. We show that during a maze task the activity of a single population in medial prefrontal cortex represents at least two different states of the world. These representations were sequential and sufficiently distinct that a downstream population could separately read out either state from that activity. Moreover, the activity representing different states is differently reactivated in sleep. Different world states can thus be represented in the same medial prefrontal cortex population, but in such a way that prevents potentially catastrophic interference between them.',\n",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'What is the relationship between language and complex thought? In the context of deductive reasoning there are two main views. Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Midbrain dopamine neurons are essential for flexible control of adaptive behaviors. DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety/stressor disorders frequently co-occur and this dual diagnosis represents a major health and economic problem worldwide. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges. Here, we assessed coordinative abilities of 120 children aged 4-12 for the two hands or a hand with another sensory signal in multiple, highly comparable sensorimotor tasks. This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains. Here, we charted the performance of 4-12- year-olds in six coordinative tasks that are all based on a common experimental paradigm but address three different sensorimotor-cognitive domains. This approach characterizes dependencies between multiple aspects of cognitive modulation in the interplay of sensory integration and motor control.',\n",

Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

Independently of the effect of saccade length, EEG amplitude was enhanced in precursor fixations compared to the other fixation categories 200-400 ms after fixation onsets, most noticeably over the occipital areas. We concluded that precursor fixations play a pivotal role in visual perception, marking the continuous occurrence of transitions between exploratory and exploitative modes of eye movement in natural viewing behavior.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'ObjectiveThe mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is one of the master coordinators of cellular stress responses, regulating metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis. We recently reported that Staufen1 (STAU1), a stress granule (SG) protein, was overabundant in fibroblast cell lines from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal degeneration, Huntingtons, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons diseases as well as animal models, and patient tissues. STAU1 overabundance is associated with mTOR hyperactivation and links SG formation with autophagy. Our objective was to determine the mechanism of mTOR regulation by STAU1.\\n\\nMethodsWe determined STAU1 abundance with disease- and chemical-induced cellular stressors in patient cells and animal models. We also used RNA binding assays to contextualize STAU1 interaction with MTOR mRNA.\\n\\nResultsSTAU1 and mTOR were overabundant in BAC-C9orf72, ATXN2Q127, and Thy1-TDP-43 transgenic mouse models. Reducing STAU1 levels in these mice normalized mTOR levels and activity and autophagy-related marker proteins. We also saw increased STAU1 levels in HEK293 cells transfected to express C9orf72-relevant dipeptide repeats (DPRs). Conversely, DPR accumulations were not observed in cells treated by STAU1 RNAi. Overexpression of STAU1 in HEK293 cells increased mTOR levels through direct MTOR mRNA interaction, activating downstream targets and impairing autophagic flux. Targeting mTOR by rapamycin or RNAi normalized STAU1 abundance in a SCA2 cellular model.\\n\\nInterpretationSTAU1 interaction with mTOR drives its hyperactivation and inhibits autophagic flux in multiple models of neurodegeneration. Staufen, therefore, constitutes a novel target to modulate mTOR activity, autophagy, and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Medial prefrontal cortex (mPfC) activity represents information about the state of the world, including present behaviour, such as decisions, and the immediate past, such as short-term memory. Unknown is whether information about different states of the world are represented in the same mPfC neural population and, if so, how they are kept distinct. To address this, we analyse here mPfC population activity of rats learning rules in a Y-maze, with self-initiated choice trials to an arm-end followed by a self-paced return during the inter-trial interval (ITI). We find that trial and ITI population activity from the same population fall into different low-dimensional subspaces. These subspaces encode different states of the world: multiple features of the task can be decoded from both trial and ITI activity, but the decoding axes for the same feature are roughly orthogonal between the two task phases, and the decodings are predominantly of features of the present during the trial but features of the preceding trial during the ITI. These subspace distinctions are carried forward into sleep, where population activity is preferentially reactivated in post-training sleep, but differently for activity from the trial and ITI subspaces. Our results suggest that the problem of interference when representing different states of the world is solved in mPfC by population activity occupying different subspaces for the world states, which can be independently decoded by downstream targets and independently addressed by upstream inputs.\\n\\nSignificance statementActivity in the medial prefrontal cortex plays a roles in representing the current and past states of the world. We show that during a maze task the activity of a single population in medial prefrontal cortex represents at least two different states of the world. These representations were sequential and sufficiently distinct that a downstream population could separately read out either state from that activity. Moreover, the activity representing different states is differently reactivated in sleep. Different world states can thus be represented in the same medial prefrontal cortex population, but in such a way that prevents potentially catastrophic interference between them.',\n",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'What is the relationship between language and complex thought? In the context of deductive reasoning there are two main views. Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Midbrain dopamine neurons are essential for flexible control of adaptive behaviors. DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety/stressor disorders frequently co-occur and this dual diagnosis represents a major health and economic problem worldwide. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges. Here, we assessed coordinative abilities of 120 children aged 4-12 for the two hands or a hand with another sensory signal in multiple, highly comparable sensorimotor tasks. This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains. Here, we charted the performance of 4-12- year-olds in six coordinative tasks that are all based on a common experimental paradigm but address three different sensorimotor-cognitive domains.

Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Eye tracking studies suggest that refixations, fixations to locations previously visited, serve to recover information lost or missed during earlier exploration of a visual scene. These studies have largely ignored the role of precursor fixations, previous fixations on locations the eyes return to later. We consider the possibility that preparations to return later are already made during precursor fixations. This would mark precursor fixations as a special category of fixations, i.e., distinct in neural activity from other fixation categories such as refixations and fixations to locations visited only once. To capture the neural signals associated with fixation categories, we analyzed EEG and eye movement recorded simultaneously in a free-viewing contour search task. We developed a methodological pipeline involving regression-based deconvolution modeling, allowing our analyses to account for overlapping EEG responses due to the saccade sequence and other oculomotor covariates. We found that precursor fixations were preceded by the largest saccades among the fixation categories. Independently of the effect of saccade length, EEG amplitude was enhanced in precursor fixations compared to the other fixation categories 200-400 ms after fixation onsets, most noticeably over the occipital areas. We concluded that precursor fixations play a pivotal role in visual perception, marking the continuous occurrence of transitions between exploratory and exploitative modes of eye movement in natural viewing behavior.',\n",

These studies have largely ignored the role of precursor fixations, previous fixations on locations the eyes return to later. We consider the possibility that preparations to return later are already made during precursor fixations. This would mark precursor fixations as a special category of fixations, i.e., distinct in neural activity from other fixation categories such as refixations and fixations to locations visited only once. To capture the neural signals associated with fixation categories, we analyzed EEG and eye movement recorded simultaneously in a free-viewing contour search task. We developed a methodological pipeline involving regression-based deconvolution modeling, allowing our analyses to account for overlapping EEG responses due to the saccade sequence and other oculomotor covariates. We found that precursor fixations were preceded by the largest saccades among the fixation categories. Independently of the effect of saccade length, EEG amplitude was enhanced in precursor fixations compared to the other fixation categories 200-400 ms after fixation onsets, most noticeably over the occipital areas. We concluded that precursor fixations play a pivotal role in visual perception, marking the continuous occurrence of transitions between exploratory and exploitative modes of eye movement in natural viewing behavior.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'ObjectiveThe mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is one of the master coordinators of cellular stress responses, regulating metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis. We recently reported that Staufen1 (STAU1), a stress granule (SG) protein, was overabundant in fibroblast cell lines from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal degeneration, Huntingtons, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons diseases as well as animal models, and patient tissues. STAU1 overabundance is associated with mTOR hyperactivation and links SG formation with autophagy. Our objective was to determine the mechanism of mTOR regulation by STAU1.\\n\\nMethodsWe determined STAU1 abundance with disease- and chemical-induced cellular stressors in patient cells and animal models. We also used RNA binding assays to contextualize STAU1 interaction with MTOR mRNA.\\n\\nResultsSTAU1 and mTOR were overabundant in BAC-C9orf72, ATXN2Q127, and Thy1-TDP-43 transgenic mouse models. Reducing STAU1 levels in these mice normalized mTOR levels and activity and autophagy-related marker proteins. We also saw increased STAU1 levels in HEK293 cells transfected to express C9orf72-relevant dipeptide repeats (DPRs). Conversely, DPR accumulations were not observed in cells treated by STAU1 RNAi. Overexpression of STAU1 in HEK293 cells increased mTOR levels through direct MTOR mRNA interaction, activating downstream targets and impairing autophagic flux. Targeting mTOR by rapamycin or RNAi normalized STAU1 abundance in a SCA2 cellular model.\\n\\nInterpretationSTAU1 interaction with mTOR drives its hyperactivation and inhibits autophagic flux in multiple models of neurodegeneration. Staufen, therefore, constitutes a novel target to modulate mTOR activity, autophagy, and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Medial prefrontal cortex (mPfC) activity represents information about the state of the world, including present behaviour, such as decisions, and the immediate past, such as short-term memory. Unknown is whether information about different states of the world are represented in the same mPfC neural population and, if so, how they are kept distinct. To address this, we analyse here mPfC population activity of rats learning rules in a Y-maze, with self-initiated choice trials to an arm-end followed by a self-paced return during the inter-trial interval (ITI). We find that trial and ITI population activity from the same population fall into different low-dimensional subspaces. These subspaces encode different states of the world: multiple features of the task can be decoded from both trial and ITI activity, but the decoding axes for the same feature are roughly orthogonal between the two task phases, and the decodings are predominantly of features of the present during the trial but features of the preceding trial during the ITI. These subspace distinctions are carried forward into sleep, where population activity is preferentially reactivated in post-training sleep, but differently for activity from the trial and ITI subspaces. Our results suggest that the problem of interference when representing different states of the world is solved in mPfC by population activity occupying different subspaces for the world states, which can be independently decoded by downstream targets and independently addressed by upstream inputs.\\n\\nSignificance statementActivity in the medial prefrontal cortex plays a roles in representing the current and past states of the world. We show that during a maze task the activity of a single population in medial prefrontal cortex represents at least two different states of the world. These representations were sequential and sufficiently distinct that a downstream population could separately read out either state from that activity. Moreover, the activity representing different states is differently reactivated in sleep. Different world states can thus be represented in the same medial prefrontal cortex population, but in such a way that prevents potentially catastrophic interference between them.',\n",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'What is the relationship between language and complex thought? In the context of deductive reasoning there are two main views. Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Midbrain dopamine neurons are essential for flexible control of adaptive behaviors. DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells.

Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety/stressor disorders frequently co-occur and this dual diagnosis represents a major health and economic problem worldwide. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges.

This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains.

Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Eye tracking studies suggest that refixations, fixations to locations previously visited, serve to recover information lost or missed during earlier exploration of a visual scene. These studies have largely ignored the role of precursor fixations, previous fixations on locations the eyes return to later. We consider the possibility that preparations to return later are already made during precursor fixations. This would mark precursor fixations as a special category of fixations, i.e., distinct in neural activity from other fixation categories such as refixations and fixations to locations visited only once. To capture the neural signals associated with fixation categories, we analyzed EEG and eye movement recorded simultaneously in a free-viewing contour search task. We developed a methodological pipeline involving regression-based deconvolution modeling, allowing our analyses to account for overlapping EEG responses due to the saccade sequence and other oculomotor covariates. We found that precursor fixations were preceded by the largest saccades among the fixation categories. Independently of the effect of saccade length, EEG amplitude was enhanced in precursor fixations compared to the other fixation categories 200-400 ms after fixation onsets, most noticeably over the occipital areas. We concluded that precursor fixations play a pivotal role in visual perception, marking the continuous occurrence of transitions between exploratory and exploitative modes of eye movement in natural viewing behavior.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Eye tracking studies suggest that refixations, fixations to locations previously visited, serve to recover information lost or missed during earlier exploration of a visual scene. These studies have largely ignored the role of precursor fixations, previous fixations on locations the eyes return to later. We consider the possibility that preparations to return later are already made during precursor fixations. This would mark precursor fixations as a special category of fixations, i.e., distinct in neural activity from other fixation categories such as refixations and fixations to locations visited only once. To capture the neural signals associated with fixation categories, we analyzed EEG and eye movement recorded simultaneously in a free-viewing contour search task. We developed a methodological pipeline involving regression-based deconvolution modeling, allowing our analyses to account for overlapping EEG responses due to the saccade sequence and other oculomotor covariates. We found that precursor fixations were preceded by the largest saccades among the fixation categories. Independently of the effect of saccade length, EEG amplitude was enhanced in precursor fixations compared to the other fixation categories 200-400 ms after fixation onsets, most noticeably over the occipital areas. We concluded that precursor fixations play a pivotal role in visual perception, marking the continuous occurrence of transitions between exploratory and exploitative modes of eye movement in natural viewing behavior.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'ObjectiveThe mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is one of the master coordinators of cellular stress responses, regulating metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis. We recently reported that Staufen1 (STAU1), a stress granule (SG) protein, was overabundant in fibroblast cell lines from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal degeneration, Huntingtons, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons diseases as well as animal models, and patient tissues. STAU1 overabundance is associated with mTOR hyperactivation and links SG formation with autophagy. Our objective was to determine the mechanism of mTOR regulation by STAU1.\\n\\nMethodsWe determined STAU1 abundance with disease- and chemical-induced cellular stressors in patient cells and animal models. We also used RNA binding assays to contextualize STAU1 interaction with MTOR mRNA.\\n\\nResultsSTAU1 and mTOR were overabundant in BAC-C9orf72, ATXN2Q127, and Thy1-TDP-43 transgenic mouse models. Reducing STAU1 levels in these mice normalized mTOR levels and activity and autophagy-related marker proteins. We also saw increased STAU1 levels in HEK293 cells transfected to express C9orf72-relevant dipeptide repeats (DPRs). Conversely, DPR accumulations were not observed in cells treated by STAU1 RNAi. Overexpression of STAU1 in HEK293 cells increased mTOR levels through direct MTOR mRNA interaction, activating downstream targets and impairing autophagic flux. Targeting mTOR by rapamycin or RNAi normalized STAU1 abundance in a SCA2 cellular model.\\n\\nInterpretationSTAU1 interaction with mTOR drives its hyperactivation and inhibits autophagic flux in multiple models of neurodegeneration. Staufen, therefore, constitutes a novel target to modulate mTOR activity, autophagy, and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Medial prefrontal cortex (mPfC) activity represents information about the state of the world, including present behaviour, such as decisions, and the immediate past, such as short-term memory. Unknown is whether information about different states of the world are represented in the same mPfC neural population and, if so, how they are kept distinct. To address this, we analyse here mPfC population activity of rats learning rules in a Y-maze, with self-initiated choice trials to an arm-end followed by a self-paced return during the inter-trial interval (ITI). We find that trial and ITI population activity from the same population fall into different low-dimensional subspaces. These subspaces encode different states of the world: multiple features of the task can be decoded from both trial and ITI activity, but the decoding axes for the same feature are roughly orthogonal between the two task phases, and the decodings are predominantly of features of the present during the trial but features of the preceding trial during the ITI. These subspace distinctions are carried forward into sleep, where population activity is preferentially reactivated in post-training sleep, but differently for activity from the trial and ITI subspaces. Our results suggest that the problem of interference when representing different states of the world is solved in mPfC by population activity occupying different subspaces for the world states, which can be independently decoded by downstream targets and independently addressed by upstream inputs.\\n\\nSignificance statementActivity in the medial prefrontal cortex plays a roles in representing the current and past states of the world. We show that during a maze task the activity of a single population in medial prefrontal cortex represents at least two different states of the world. These representations were sequential and sufficiently distinct that a downstream population could separately read out either state from that activity. Moreover, the activity representing different states is differently reactivated in sleep. Different world states can thus be represented in the same medial prefrontal cortex population, but in such a way that prevents potentially catastrophic interference between them.',\n",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'What is the relationship between language and complex thought? In the context of deductive reasoning there are two main views. Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Midbrain dopamine neurons are essential for flexible control of adaptive behaviors. DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety/stressor disorders frequently co-occur and this dual diagnosis represents a major health and economic problem worldwide. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

Interdependencies between different sensorimotor control mechanisms as well as bodily abilities are difficult to assess when isolated experiments are tested in small age ranges.

This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains.

Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Eye tracking studies suggest that refixations, fixations to locations previously visited, serve to recover information lost or missed during earlier exploration of a visual scene. These studies have largely ignored the role of precursor fixations, previous fixations on locations the eyes return to later. We consider the possibility that preparations to return later are already made during precursor fixations. This would mark precursor fixations as a special category of fixations, i.e., distinct in neural activity from other fixation categories such as refixations and fixations to locations visited only once. To capture the neural signals associated with fixation categories, we analyzed EEG and eye movement recorded simultaneously in a free-viewing contour search task. We developed a methodological pipeline involving regression-based deconvolution modeling, allowing our analyses to account for overlapping EEG responses due to the saccade sequence and other oculomotor covariates. We found that precursor fixations were preceded by the largest saccades among the fixation categories. Independently of the effect of saccade length, EEG amplitude was enhanced in precursor fixations compared to the other fixation categories 200-400 ms after fixation onsets, most noticeably over the occipital areas. We concluded that precursor fixations play a pivotal role in visual perception, marking the continuous occurrence of transitions between exploratory and exploitative modes of eye movement in natural viewing behavior.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Eye tracking studies suggest that refixations, fixations to locations previously visited, serve to recover information lost or missed during earlier exploration of a visual scene. These studies have largely ignored the role of precursor fixations, previous fixations on locations the eyes return to later. We consider the possibility that preparations to return later are already made during precursor fixations. This would mark precursor fixations as a special category of fixations, i.e., distinct in neural activity from other fixation categories such as refixations and fixations to locations visited only once. To capture the neural signals associated with fixation categories, we analyzed EEG and eye movement recorded simultaneously in a free-viewing contour search task. We developed a methodological pipeline involving regression-based deconvolution modeling, allowing our analyses to account for overlapping EEG responses due to the saccade sequence and other oculomotor covariates. We found that precursor fixations were preceded by the largest saccades among the fixation categories. Independently of the effect of saccade length, EEG amplitude was enhanced in precursor fixations compared to the other fixation categories 200-400 ms after fixation onsets, most noticeably over the occipital areas. We concluded that precursor fixations play a pivotal role in visual perception, marking the continuous occurrence of transitions between exploratory and exploitative modes of eye movement in natural viewing behavior.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'ObjectiveThe mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is one of the master coordinators of cellular stress responses, regulating metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis. We recently reported that Staufen1 (STAU1), a stress granule (SG) protein, was overabundant in fibroblast cell lines from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal degeneration, Huntingtons, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons diseases as well as animal models, and patient tissues. STAU1 overabundance is associated with mTOR hyperactivation and links SG formation with autophagy. Our objective was to determine the mechanism of mTOR regulation by STAU1.\\n\\nMethodsWe determined STAU1 abundance with disease- and chemical-induced cellular stressors in patient cells and animal models. We also used RNA binding assays to contextualize STAU1 interaction with MTOR mRNA.\\n\\nResultsSTAU1 and mTOR were overabundant in BAC-C9orf72, ATXN2Q127, and Thy1-TDP-43 transgenic mouse models. Reducing STAU1 levels in these mice normalized mTOR levels and activity and autophagy-related marker proteins. We also saw increased STAU1 levels in HEK293 cells transfected to express C9orf72-relevant dipeptide repeats (DPRs). Conversely, DPR accumulations were not observed in cells treated by STAU1 RNAi. Overexpression of STAU1 in HEK293 cells increased mTOR levels through direct MTOR mRNA interaction, activating downstream targets and impairing autophagic flux. Targeting mTOR by rapamycin or RNAi normalized STAU1 abundance in a SCA2 cellular model.\\n\\nInterpretationSTAU1 interaction with mTOR drives its hyperactivation and inhibits autophagic flux in multiple models of neurodegeneration. Staufen, therefore, constitutes a novel target to modulate mTOR activity, autophagy, and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Medial prefrontal cortex (mPfC) activity represents information about the state of the world, including present behaviour, such as decisions, and the immediate past, such as short-term memory. Unknown is whether information about different states of the world are represented in the same mPfC neural population and, if so, how they are kept distinct. To address this, we analyse here mPfC population activity of rats learning rules in a Y-maze, with self-initiated choice trials to an arm-end followed by a self-paced return during the inter-trial interval (ITI). We find that trial and ITI population activity from the same population fall into different low-dimensional subspaces. These subspaces encode different states of the world: multiple features of the task can be decoded from both trial and ITI activity, but the decoding axes for the same feature are roughly orthogonal between the two task phases, and the decodings are predominantly of features of the present during the trial but features of the preceding trial during the ITI. These subspace distinctions are carried forward into sleep, where population activity is preferentially reactivated in post-training sleep, but differently for activity from the trial and ITI subspaces. Our results suggest that the problem of interference when representing different states of the world is solved in mPfC by population activity occupying different subspaces for the world states, which can be independently decoded by downstream targets and independently addressed by upstream inputs.\\n\\nSignificance statementActivity in the medial prefrontal cortex plays a roles in representing the current and past states of the world. We show that during a maze task the activity of a single population in medial prefrontal cortex represents at least two different states of the world. These representations were sequential and sufficiently distinct that a downstream population could separately read out either state from that activity. Moreover, the activity representing different states is differently reactivated in sleep. Different world states can thus be represented in the same medial prefrontal cortex population, but in such a way that prevents potentially catastrophic interference between them.',\n",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'What is the relationship between language and complex thought? In the context of deductive reasoning there are two main views. Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Midbrain dopamine neurons are essential for flexible control of adaptive behaviors. DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.',\n",

Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety/stressor disorders frequently co-occur and this dual diagnosis represents a major health and economic problem worldwide. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains.

Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Eye tracking studies suggest that refixations, fixations to locations previously visited, serve to recover information lost or missed during earlier exploration of a visual scene. These studies have largely ignored the role of precursor fixations, previous fixations on locations the eyes return to later. We consider the possibility that preparations to return later are already made during precursor fixations. This would mark precursor fixations as a special category of fixations, i.e., distinct in neural activity from other fixation categories such as refixations and fixations to locations visited only once. To capture the neural signals associated with fixation categories, we analyzed EEG and eye movement recorded simultaneously in a free-viewing contour search task. We developed a methodological pipeline involving regression-based deconvolution modeling, allowing our analyses to account for overlapping EEG responses due to the saccade sequence and other oculomotor covariates. We found that precursor fixations were preceded by the largest saccades among the fixation categories. Independently of the effect of saccade length, EEG amplitude was enhanced in precursor fixations compared to the other fixation categories 200-400 ms after fixation onsets, most noticeably over the occipital areas.

       " 'abstract': 'Eye tracking studies suggest that refixations, fixations to locations previously visited, serve to recover information lost or missed during earlier exploration of a visual scene. These studies have largely ignored the role of precursor fixations, previous fixations on locations the eyes return to later. We consider the possibility that preparations to return later are already made during precursor fixations. This would mark precursor fixations as a special category of fixations, i.e., distinct in neural activity from other fixation categories such as refixations and fixations to locations visited only once. To capture the neural signals associated with fixation categories, we analyzed EEG and eye movement recorded simultaneously in a free-viewing contour search task. We developed a methodological pipeline involving regression-based deconvolution modeling, allowing our analyses to account for overlapping EEG responses due to the saccade sequence and other oculomotor covariates. We found that precursor fixations were preceded by the largest saccades among the fixation categories. Independently of the effect of saccade length, EEG amplitude was enhanced in precursor fixations compared to the other fixation categories 200-400 ms after fixation onsets, most noticeably over the occipital areas. We concluded that precursor fixations play a pivotal role in visual perception, marking the continuous occurrence of transitions between exploratory and exploitative modes of eye movement in natural viewing behavior.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'ObjectiveThe mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is one of the master coordinators of cellular stress responses, regulating metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis. We recently reported that Staufen1 (STAU1), a stress granule (SG) protein, was overabundant in fibroblast cell lines from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal degeneration, Huntingtons, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons diseases as well as animal models, and patient tissues. STAU1 overabundance is associated with mTOR hyperactivation and links SG formation with autophagy. Our objective was to determine the mechanism of mTOR regulation by STAU1.\\n\\nMethodsWe determined STAU1 abundance with disease- and chemical-induced cellular stressors in patient cells and animal models. We also used RNA binding assays to contextualize STAU1 interaction with MTOR mRNA.\\n\\nResultsSTAU1 and mTOR were overabundant in BAC-C9orf72, ATXN2Q127, and Thy1-TDP-43 transgenic mouse models. Reducing STAU1 levels in these mice normalized mTOR levels and activity and autophagy-related marker proteins. We also saw increased STAU1 levels in HEK293 cells transfected to express C9orf72-relevant dipeptide repeats (DPRs). Conversely, DPR accumulations were not observed in cells treated by STAU1 RNAi. Overexpression of STAU1 in HEK293 cells increased mTOR levels through direct MTOR mRNA interaction, activating downstream targets and impairing autophagic flux. Targeting mTOR by rapamycin or RNAi normalized STAU1 abundance in a SCA2 cellular model.\\n\\nInterpretationSTAU1 interaction with mTOR drives its hyperactivation and inhibits autophagic flux in multiple models of neurodegeneration. Staufen, therefore, constitutes a novel target to modulate mTOR activity, autophagy, and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Medial prefrontal cortex (mPfC) activity represents information about the state of the world, including present behaviour, such as decisions, and the immediate past, such as short-term memory. Unknown is whether information about different states of the world are represented in the same mPfC neural population and, if so, how they are kept distinct. To address this, we analyse here mPfC population activity of rats learning rules in a Y-maze, with self-initiated choice trials to an arm-end followed by a self-paced return during the inter-trial interval (ITI). We find that trial and ITI population activity from the same population fall into different low-dimensional subspaces. These subspaces encode different states of the world: multiple features of the task can be decoded from both trial and ITI activity, but the decoding axes for the same feature are roughly orthogonal between the two task phases, and the decodings are predominantly of features of the present during the trial but features of the preceding trial during the ITI. These subspace distinctions are carried forward into sleep, where population activity is preferentially reactivated in post-training sleep, but differently for activity from the trial and ITI subspaces. Our results suggest that the problem of interference when representing different states of the world is solved in mPfC by population activity occupying different subspaces for the world states, which can be independently decoded by downstream targets and independently addressed by upstream inputs.\\n\\nSignificance statementActivity in the medial prefrontal cortex plays a roles in representing the current and past states of the world. We show that during a maze task the activity of a single population in medial prefrontal cortex represents at least two different states of the world. These representations were sequential and sufficiently distinct that a downstream population could separately read out either state from that activity. Moreover, the activity representing different states is differently reactivated in sleep. Different world states can thus be represented in the same medial prefrontal cortex population, but in such a way that prevents potentially catastrophic interference between them.',\n",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.',\n",

Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Midbrain dopamine neurons are essential for flexible control of adaptive behaviors. DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\\n\\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\\n\\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\\n\\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells.

Previous work has shown that the number of glia per unit volume of neocortex is constant across mammalian species. We hypothesize that the conservation of glia volume density within brain regions might be a governing principle of organization across species. To test this hypothesis, we used stereology, light microscopy, and data available in the literature to examine five brain regions: the cerebral cortex and four brain regions that differ from the cerebral cortex and each other - the anterior piriform cortex, the posterior piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellum. We discovered two orderly relationships: First, glia volume density within a brain region was constant across species, including humans, although it significantly differed between regions, suggesting that glia density might constitute a region-specific marker. Second, the ratio of glia to neuron increased with brain volume according to a [1/4] power law in the primate frontal cortex and the neocortex, the mammalian paleocortex, and the cerebellum. These relationships show that the development of glia and neurons are coupled, and suggest that what a neural circuit computes depends as much on its glial components as on its neurons.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIThe volume density of glia (i.e., number of glia per unit volume) within a brain region is con-served across mammalian species including humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ratio of glia to neuron increases with bigger brains.\\nC_LIO_LIThe volume density of glia is significantly different across functionally and architecturally dif-ferent brain regions and could function as a region-specific marker.\\nC_LIO_LIGlia obey scaling constraints that are different from scaling constraints for neurons.\\nC_LI',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety/stressor disorders frequently co-occur and this dual diagnosis represents a major health and economic problem worldwide. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety/stressor-related disorders.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\\nC_LI',\n",

This multi-task approach allowed assessing the development and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal. The ability to strategically ignore sensory information was available last. The pattern of partial correlations among tasks suggests protracted, interdependent, chained development within individuals.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYDevelopment unfolds as a cascade: each new ability sets the stage for learning further skills in motor, sensory, cognitive, and social domains.

Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Eye tracking studies suggest that refixations, fixations to locations previously visited, serve to recover information lost or missed during earlier exploration of a visual scene. These studies have largely ignored the role of precursor fixations, previous fixations on locations the eyes return to later. We consider the possibility that preparations to return later are already made during precursor fixations. This would mark precursor fixations as a special category of fixations, i.e., distinct in neural activity from other fixation categories such as refixations and fixations to locations visited only once. To capture the neural signals associated with fixation categories, we analyzed EEG and eye movement recorded simultaneously in a free-viewing contour search task. We developed a methodological pipeline involving regression-based deconvolution modeling, allowing our analyses to account for overlapping EEG responses due to the saccade sequence and other oculomotor covariates. We found that precursor fixations were preceded by the largest saccades among the fixation categories. Independently of the effect of saccade length, EEG amplitude was enhanced in precursor fixations compared to the other fixation categories 200-400 ms after fixation onsets, most noticeably over the occipital areas. We concluded that precursor fixations play a pivotal role in visual perception, marking the continuous occurrence of transitions between exploratory and exploitative modes of eye movement in natural viewing behavior.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Eye tracking studies suggest that refixations, fixations to locations previously visited, serve to recover information lost or missed during earlier exploration of a visual scene. These studies have largely ignored the role of precursor fixations, previous fixations on locations the eyes return to later. We consider the possibility that preparations to return later are already made during precursor fixations. This would mark precursor fixations as a special category of fixations, i.e., distinct in neural activity from other fixation categories such as refixations and fixations to locations visited only once. To capture the neural signals associated with fixation categories, we analyzed EEG and eye movement recorded simultaneously in a free-viewing contour search task. We developed a methodological pipeline involving regression-based deconvolution modeling, allowing our analyses to account for overlapping EEG responses due to the saccade sequence and other oculomotor covariates.

       " 'abstract': 'ObjectiveThe mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is one of the master coordinators of cellular stress responses, regulating metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis. We recently reported that Staufen1 (STAU1), a stress granule (SG) protein, was overabundant in fibroblast cell lines from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal degeneration, Huntingtons, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons diseases as well as animal models, and patient tissues. STAU1 overabundance is associated with mTOR hyperactivation and links SG formation with autophagy. Our objective was to determine the mechanism of mTOR regulation by STAU1.\\n\\nMethodsWe determined STAU1 abundance with disease- and chemical-induced cellular stressors in patient cells and animal models. We also used RNA binding assays to contextualize STAU1 interaction with MTOR mRNA.\\n\\nResultsSTAU1 and mTOR were overabundant in BAC-C9orf72, ATXN2Q127, and Thy1-TDP-43 transgenic mouse models. Reducing STAU1 levels in these mice normalized mTOR levels and activity and autophagy-related marker proteins. We also saw increased STAU1 levels in HEK293 cells transfected to express C9orf72-relevant dipeptide repeats (DPRs). Conversely, DPR accumulations were not observed in cells treated by STAU1 RNAi. Overexpression of STAU1 in HEK293 cells increased mTOR levels through direct MTOR mRNA interaction, activating downstream targets and impairing autophagic flux. Targeting mTOR by rapamycin or RNAi normalized STAU1 abundance in a SCA2 cellular model.\\n\\nInterpretationSTAU1 interaction with mTOR drives its hyperactivation and inhibits autophagic flux in multiple models of neurodegeneration. Staufen, therefore, constitutes a novel target to modulate mTOR activity, autophagy, and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",

       " 'abstract': 'Medial prefrontal cortex (mPfC) activity represents information about the state of the world, including present behaviour, such as decisions, and the immediate past, such as short-term memory. Unknown is whether information about different states of the world are represented in the same mPfC neural population and, if so, how they are kept distinct. To address this, we analyse here mPfC population activity of rats learning rules in a Y-maze, with self-initiated choice trials to an arm-end followed by a self-paced return during the inter-trial interval (ITI). We find that trial and ITI population activity from the same population fall into different low-dimensional subspaces. These subspaces encode different states of the world: multiple features of the task can be decoded from both trial and ITI activity, but the decoding axes for the same feature are roughly orthogonal between the two task phases, and the decodings are predominantly of features of the present during the trial but features of the preceding trial during the ITI. These subspace distinctions are carried forward into sleep, where population activity is preferentially reactivated in post-training sleep, but differently for activity from the trial and ITI subspaces. Our results suggest that the problem of interference when representing different states of the world is solved in mPfC by population activity occupying different subspaces for the world states, which can be independently decoded by downstream targets and independently addressed by upstream inputs.\\n\\nSignificance statementActivity in the medial prefrontal cortex plays a roles in representing the current and past states of the world. We show that during a maze task the activity of a single population in medial prefrontal cortex represents at least two different states of the world. These representations were sequential and sufficiently distinct that a downstream population could separately read out either state from that activity. Moreover, the activity representing different states is differently reactivated in sleep. Different world states can thus be represented in the same medial prefrontal cortex population, but in such a way that prevents potentially catastrophic interference between them.',\n",
